And they might be an important frontier for higher education in 2025, according to Ardis Kadiu, founder of ed-tech company Element451.\\nSpeaking to attendees at the ASU+GSV Summit AI Show on April 6, Kadiu said students increasingly expect intelligent, personalized experiences from their institutions that traditional staffing simply can’t provide. Kadiu cited author and journalist Jeff Selingo in pointing out that students can wait two to six weeks for appointments with mental health services and up to two and a half hours for financial aid assistance, but they want those experiences to be efficient and personal.\\n“This avalanche is coming in, and more support is needed,” Kadiu said. “AI can really bridge that gap.”\\nIn 2012, he said, AI was about perceiving the world around us, through functions such as speech recognition and image identification, with common applications in translation and medical imaging. The next big jump was in late 2022 with generative AI, which creates content rather than just analyzing it. In 2025, Kadiu said, agentic AI takes action rather than only responding to real-time prompts to generate content.\\nThat means there are new opportunities to use AI not just as a tool, but as a teammate, and Kadiu predicted that early adopters will have a competitive advantage. Through live demonstrations, he showed his audience a variety of uses for AI agents in higher education, from admissions counseling to campaign strategizing.\\nKadiu's company, Element451, is one of many offering AI agent services for higher education. On the surface, some of these services may resemble generative AI systems that users are more familiar with, but behind the scenes, they involve a system of AI agents working together, similar to how human staff would.\\nKadiu said AI agents are specialized with a skill type, a goal, a communication style and a set of actions it can take, like initiating an email or phone call. While the agent can take action on its own, it also has a set of “approvers” linked to it who OK each action before it takes place.\\nFor example, a recruiting agent might have the overall goal of getting a student to apply to a university. It will use existing university data systems to determine the best time for outreach, then create an email, SMS message, phone call or WhatsApp message. If that action is approved, the agent will store a transcript of the outreach plus any questions it fields in the student’s file, which the agent will use to inform human staff as well as its next course of action.\\n“We can just give the goal and provide all the tools and let the AI reason about it, and because it's built on all of the context and the data and all the prior conversations, it's probably the best way to kind of bring all those pieces together and not miss anything, right?” Kadiu said. “Imagine that you have to go from person to person, or that you have to see 500 students. It’s impossible to keep all their context in your head.”\\nIn the live demonstration, when Element451’s Vice President of Product Eric Range told an agent named Carolyn that he was ready to apply to the fictional Element University’s nursing program, Carolyn sent him a link to the application in real time.\\nAnother use case might be for financial aid help, especially with recent Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) hiccups. Kadiu said the Element451 financial aid agent is trained on studentaid.gov resources, and institutions can input their own resources as well. Specializing the agents means that one chatbot doesn’t need to know everything about the university, it just needs to know what the other agents do.\\n“They can hand things off to each other, just like a real human team would on the support channel,” Kadiu said.\\nFor example, when Range used a chatbot to ask about scholarships, a financial aid agent named Finley answered his questions. When he moved on to questions about athletic scholarships and asked how to try out for the soccer team, Finley passed him to a different agent specializing in athletics named Coach Carter.\\nOutside of community-facing communications, the reasoning abilities of AI agents can make them helpful for things like application management. Kadiu showed off an agent that evaluated applications based on a given criteria and gave a preliminary score.\\n“It’s making references to the documents: ‘Shows a GPA of 3.7, which places them above the 3.5 threshold. However, none of the provided documents include evidence of at least three AP honors courses,’ and that was part of the criteria,” Kadiu said.\\nThe agent also assessed the application for fraud.\\nIn the future, Kadiu said, AI agents could be added to course management systems to provide personalized interventions for students based on criteria like not attending class or missing assignments. But there are limits to what he will ask AI agents to do.\\n“We made a clear delineation in the sand, so to speak, around, ‘Hey, we don’t want to mess around with the class pedagogy right now,’” he said.\\nFacebook\\nLinkedIn\\nTwitter\\nPrint\\nEmail\\nTags:\\nArtificial Intelligence Higher EducationEducationASU+GSV\\nAbby Sourwine\\nAbby Sourwine is a staff writer for the Center for Digital Education.

It posits that everyone in the educational system, from students to teachers to administrators, must understand what AI is and where it comes from, how to use it in their educational context and how to evaluate tools and use cases.\\nAt the AI Show at the ASU+GSV Summit April 6, panelists from Digital Promise, Gwinnett County Public Schools in Georgia and the Kapor Center shared what this framework involves and how schools and districts have implemented AI literacy lessons to suit their needs.\\nUNDERSTAND\\nShayla Cornick, director of research and development for ed tech at Digital Promise, said understanding the basics of AI is of foundational importance for being an informed user or procurer of the technology.\\n“Understanding AI is an essential component of AI literacy, because in order to make informed decisions about using AI and evaluating AI, you have to know what it is,” Cornick said. “You have to understand how artificial intelligence data sets are created and associations and automated connections.”\\nFor Sallie Holloway, director of AI and computer science at Gwinnett County Public Schools in Georgia, this means everybody needs to be included in programs that promote AI understanding, so it can’t be an elective or afterschool activity.\\nThe best way for districts to add AI lessons, she said, is to embed them into strategic and instructional goals they already have.\\n“As I travel, every educational space looks different, it feels different, and I am always cognizant of time. It is a precious commodity,” Nicole Adell, associate director for school impact at Digital Promise, said. “I don’t want my district and school leaders feeling like, 'This is something else I’ve got to make some time for.'”\\nAdell said outreach to parents and caregivers to hear what they think about the role AI should play in education is an important part of this, as it also gives the community a chance to understand the basics around AI and what local schools are doing to keep data safe. One school she worked with recently in South Jersey held community outreach events every month for this purpose.\\nUSE\\nSeveral panelists made the point that understanding AI is a prerequisite for using it. That way, students, teachers and leaders are equipped to make the first decision: to opt in or out. This could be for using AI at all, using a specific tool or using AI in a specific setting.\\n“We have to let people understand that it is OK to say no to the technology,” Shana White, director of computer science equity initiatives at the Kapor Center, said, qualifying that educators shouldn't feel like it’s a bad thing to opt out.\\nIntroducing AI to reticent staff members tends to work best when it's done through existing meetings and systems, Adell said. For example, one school redesigned an upcoming staff meeting to incorporate discussing AI and trying out new tools.\\nHolloway said that teachers incorporating AI into lessons should ground it in real-world examples to encourage critical thinking that will be applicable even when students go off into jobs that haven’t been invented yet.\\n“If it’s siloed in just that content and just that one example, and it never leaves the classroom and never brings in real-world examples, then those students don't know how to then apply that learning,” she said.\\nIncorporating AI use into classroom lessons may involve discussions of what ethical use looks like. For White, this comes down to three questions: Does it harm you? Does it harm others? Does it harm the environment?\\nIf it doesn’t pass any of the criteria on that test, she said, the question becomes: How can the user engage it responsibly?\\nIn this way, learning about AI use ties into understanding how it works, as potential harms — such as adverse environmental impacts and exploitative labor practices — should be part of discussions about what AI is and where it comes from, White said.\\nEVALUATE\\nDigital Promise’s framework for AI literacy extends to the consideration of ethical personal use and the ability to evaluate AI tools on the whole. This largely includes knowing which questions to ask, either internally to oneself or out loud to a vendor, depending on one's role.\\nFor students, parents and caregivers, White said relevant questions are: Who is creating this tool, and who isn’t? Who is benefiting from these tools, and who isn’t?\\nIn addition to these questions, decision-makers in the education world, from classroom teachers to superintendents, should know additional questions to ask around data privacy, Holloway said. Vendors should be able to answer: Why did you create this tool? Is your tool appropriate for the age range in my building? Where does your training data come from, and what is my students’ data going into?\\nGwinnett County Schools has an in-house team focused on procurement, and Holloway said they haven’t approved very many AI tools.\\n“We want our students, when it’s age appropriate, when it’s appropriate to the context, to have the experience, because application is important to understand how things work,” she said. “But we really want to do that in a protected environment.”\\nFacebook\\nLinkedIn\\nTwitter\\nPrint\\nEmail\\nTags:\\nArtificial Intelligence K-12EducationASU+GSV\\nAbby Sourwine\\nAbby Sourwine is a staff writer for the Center for Digital Education.

After clawing back from pandemic-era enrollment declines, higher education faces a new wave of pressure: deliver more, with less—again.\\nElement451 believes that\\'s not just unsustainable—it\\'s unacceptable.\\xa0Today, the AI-first student engagement platform announced the launch of Bolt Agents, a first-of-its-kind AI workforce built for higher ed. Fully integrated into the Element451 CRM, Bolt Agents are proactive, goal-oriented teammates designed to support overextended staff—not replace them.\\nIn a moment defined by uncertainty, burnout, and resource constraints, Bolt Agents offer a resilient, flexible way for schools to meet growing demands while staying human-first. It\\'s how institutions can become #dogeproof—without sacrificing service or sanity.\\nPurpose-Built for the Pressures of Higher Ed\\nUnlike traditional AI tools that wait for a prompt, Bolt Agents act with intention.\\nEach agent is built for a specific job and can interpret data, personalize outreach, build communications, and execute across channels. They complete real projects from start to finish, delivering results—not just output.\\nAnd they do it in the platform, using the data, goals, and context already in Element451. There\\'s no third-party software to stitch together or babysit.\\nImagine this:\\nYou oversee enrollment at a large community college. Before heading out for a mid-summer break, you assign your Enrollment Agent a goal: get 500 newly admitted Health Sciences students registered for fall. When you return, the update\\'s waiting—537 students enrolled, questions answered, and no time lost.\\nOr you lead student success at a small liberal arts school. You ask your Academic Advisor Agent to re-engage first-year students who haven\\'t registered for the next term. Within days, nudges go out, support is delivered, and registration rates are rising—without pulling your team off other priorities.\\nStaff can review, edit, and approve the agent\\'s work—just like they would with a junior colleague. As trust builds, they delegate more, knowing oversight is always built in.\\nNot Just Automation—The Rise of the Hybrid Workforce\\nBolt Agents are part of a broader shift taking hold across industries: the hybrid workforce, where humans and AI work side by side. McKinsey predicts that generative and agentic AI could automate up to 30% of work hours in higher education by 2030, enabling staff to focus on more strategic, human-centered responsibilities.\\nBy offloading time-consuming tasks to AI teammates, institutions can redistribute workloads, avoid staff fatigue, and stay adaptive in the face of shifting policies and shrinking budgets. It\\'s a way to keep work moving—without stretching people too thin.\\nFlexible Support for Uncertain Times\\nHigher ed professionals have been overworked for too long. When peak seasons like orientation hit—or a team member is out—Bolt Agents step in without additional overhead, overtime, or frustration.\\n\"No other platform in higher ed can do this,\" said Ardis Kadiu, CEO of Element451. \"We\\'ve transformed AI from a feature into a teammate. Most AI is reactive—ours is proactive. It thinks, plans, acts, and improves, always guided by the goals of the institution and the people behind it.\"\\nThis is agentic AI—technology that reasons through goals and produces results, not just content. Gartner projects that 33% of enterprise apps will include agentic AI by 2028, up from less than 1% in 2024.\\nBolt Agents bring that future to higher ed today.\\nCome Build Your First Agent\\nBolt Agents are available now and already in use by Element451 partner institutions.\\nAt Element451\\'s Engage Summit in June, attendees will get hands-on experience with Bolt Agents—and the opportunity to build one tailored to their institution\\'s goals. It\\'s the fastest way to go from overwhelmed to operational, from task lists to outcomes.\\nIf higher ed is going to survive the next wave of uncertainty, it can\\'t keep asking humans to do it all.\\nRegister for the Summit\\xa0and see how AI can protect your team\\'s time and morale.\\nAbout Element451\\nElement451\\xa0is the AI-first CRM that gives colleges and universities a digital workforce to attract, enroll, and support today\\'s students. Schools can assign projects to Bolt Agents — AI teammates that can interpret data, write content, segment audiences, personalize outreach, and adjust tactics as they go. Staff stay in control while getting time back for the human work students value most. From prospect to post-graduation, Element451 helps schools connect with students in smarter, faster, and more personal ways.\\nPress Contact\\nBrandon Hurter\\nbrandon.hurter@element451.com\\nView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/higher-eds-ai-workforce-has-arrived-element451-introduces-bolt-agents-302421540.html\\nSOURCE Element451\\nMore in Markets\\nView All\\n### Morningstar’s Take on Tariffs: Stock Impacts, Portfolio Tips, and More What Trump’s tariff hikes mean for stocks, the economy, and global markets.

Additionally, the research indicates that virtual learning could help narrowing historic achievement and workforce gaps in the STEM fields.\\n\"They’re not just executing recipe-like science labs—they’re in the immersive world exploring and working through expertly designed lab assignments that connect to the VR story,” said Annie Hale, executive director at the EdPlus Action Lab and lead author of the paper. “And that’s leading to real, measurable gains in learning and persistence in STEM.”\\nMost Popular\\nTrump Sets Demands Harvard Must Meet to Regain Federal Funds\\nHow Trump Is Wreaking Havoc on the Student Visa System\\nVanderbilt’s Program for Neurodivergent Ph.D.s Loses Its Funding\\nSince fall 2022, aspiring scientists, doctors, engineers and other STEM majors at ASU have been required to pair their Bio 181 and Bio 182 lectures with a series of 15-minute virtual reality lab sessions in a 3-D intergalactic wildlife sanctuary, where dinosaur-like creatures are on the brink of extinction. Students create field scientist avatars and traverse the virtual world to collect samples and data before returning to the classroom to analyze their findings and use real-world biological principles to save the creatures.\\nWhen ASU first piloted the course in spring 2022, a randomized study of about 500 students showed virtual reality’s initial promise in alleviating the historically high attrition rates—especially for low-income, female and nonwhite students—in introductory STEM classes that have long plagued ASU and universities nationwide. Students in the virtual reality lab group were 1.7 times more likely to score between 90\\xa0percent and 100\\xa0percent on their lab assignments compared to students in the conventional lab group.\\nA scene from the virtual reality biology lab offered at ASU.\\nWhile those results indicated early success of the concept, some experts told Inside Higher Ed at the time that they were interested in seeing long-term outcomes before categorizing it as a “settled piece of pedagogy.”\\nAdvertisement\\nHale had a similar idea.\\n“After we saw great results from that trial, I wondered if it was just a semester effect,” she said. “Pedagogical adjustments can boost ABC rates and student satisfaction, but it doesn’t always have long-term implications.”\\nTo answer that question, Hale and her research team developed a two-year longitudinal study that tracked more than 4,000 students’ learning outcomes in the two-course introductory biology lab sequence between fall 2022—when ASU began requiring all STEM majors to take the virtual reality biology labs—and spring 2024.\\nThey found that students who took the virtual reality biology lab, on average, improved their final course mark by one-quarter of a grade between Bio 181 and Bio 182. Compared to students who took those two courses between 2018 and 2022—prior to the introduction of virtual reality—students in the virtual reality cohort also scored one-quarter of a letter grade higher in advanced biology courses, including general and molecular genetics.\\nResults of the study also showed that students who took the virtual reality lab were more likely than their peers to remain STEM majors, and that they consistently performed well on all lab assignments regardless of their high school preparation levels, income, race, ethnicity or gender.\\nResearchers also conducted pre- and post-class student surveys, interviews, and classroom observations to inform their findings, which revealed strong and lasting emotional investment in the high-stakes narrative of saving the creatures in the intergalactic wildlife sanctuary.\\nEditors\\' Picks\\nSmashing the Student Visa System\\nHow Researchers Could Get Their Canceled NIH Grants Back\\nResearchers, Higher Ed Union Fight NIH Grant Terminations\\n“Students come out crying because the story line is so interesting and engaging,” Hale said. “In a world where science curriculum can be boring, hard or a lot of math, the [story] motivates them when the quantitative aspects are challenging. They want to solve it because they want to know what happens next.”\\n‘Ability to Feel Successful’\\nVirtual reality has a decades-old presence in the education-technology world, but educators often deploy it tangentially, through one-time experiences that aren’t critical to passing a particular course. Although some of those efforts have yielded anecdotal and small-scale evidence that virtual reality can boost student engagement, the latest data on the technology’s incorporation into biology labs offers more robust, large-scale proof that ASU’s broader investments in virtual reality education are already paying off.\\nIn 2020, the university partnered with the technology and entertainment company Dreamscape Immersive—a virtual reality company with ties to notable Hollywood productions, such as WarGames and Men in Black—to create Dreamscape Learn. Over the past five years, the company has developed numerous virtual reality courses for ASU and more than a dozen other K-12 and higher education institutions across numerous disciplines, including art history, chemistry and astronomy.\\nBut ASU’s traditional introductory biology courses were among Dreamscape Learn’s first endeavors, as it aligned with the university’s push to broaden participation in STEM fields.\\nNumerous studies have identified such courses as some of the biggest barriers to completing a STEM degree and landing a well-paying job, especially for students who didn’t complete a rigorous biology course in high school.\\nIn typical biology labs, “students are asked to design experiments and hypotheses, but they haven’t actually been taught the skills to do that,” said John VandenBrooks, a zoology professor and ASU’s associate dean of immersive learning, who helped design the virtual reality labs. “For students who come in with a strong background, that’s easier for them to engage with. But other students who haven’t had that same experience really struggle\\xa0… They feel behind already.”\\nLeveling the playing field through novel problem-solving is what motivated him to ground the curriculum in a fictional universe.\\n“Nobody has solved the problems in the intergalactic wildlife sanctuary,” VandenBrooks said. “It gives them a foundation and the ability to feel successful early on in their higher education career and be able to continue on.”\\nMaking ‘Meaning Out of Complexity’\\nBut virtual reality isn’t about making these fundamental STEM courses any less rigorous, but rather teaching students transferable critical thinking skills, those involved with the courses say.\\n“One of the advantages of making these fictional narratives is that we can develop the story in such a way so that students have to deploy very specific skills at a very specific time to solve that problem,” VandenBrooks said. “That creates a very clear learning progression that goes across this entire curriculum and that really benefits students in their skill development versus giving them a series of labs or assignments that are related but don’t necessarily have as clear of a progression.”\\nAnd having those complex reasoning skills are what the droves of STEM majors who want to work in the medical field, for instance, will need to succeed in their careers.\\n“The key to being a good doctor is knowing what’s abnormal in the normal,” said VandenBrooks, who previously worked at Midwestern University, a private medical school with locations in Arizona and Illinois. “When things are easy, you can use an algorithm, but when things aren’t, you have to do all of this problem-solving. That’s the doctor you want when things are really going wrong, and that’s what we’re trying to train students for.”\\nJeremy Bailenson, founding director of Stanford University’s Virtual Human Interaction Lab at the education graduate school, who did not participate in any aspect of ASU’s study, said education research can benefit from studies with large sample sizes to affirm prior studies on virtual reality in education.\\nIn general, immersive learning experiences “reduce barriers to people believing they can succeed in the realm of science,” he said. “If you’re someone who’s been told your whole life that you don’t fit the mold of a typical scientist—because of your income, race, gender or ethnicity—VR provides learners the agency to see themselves as scientists.”\\nAlthough the study demonstrates how that theory is already at work in ASU’s virtual reality biology labs, it may not be a feasible approach for every college and university.\\nAccording to Josh Reibel, CEO of Dreamscape Learn, implementing the virtual reality education system (which includes software fees and the one-time costs of installing an immersive classroom called a pod) costs “mid–five figures to low six figures,” depending on the size of the school and the scale of the curricular offerings.\\nIn March 2022, The Arizona Republic reported that ASU had at that point invested $5\\xa0million in “philanthropic investment for development” to build out a virtual reality biology lab.\\nIf an institution can afford it, virtual reality also offers a strategy for teaching students to think beyond memorization and regurgitations in the age of generative artificial intelligence.\\n“The more you can use AI to transmit facts, the more pressure there is on higher education to do more than just transmit facts,” Reibel said. “That helps educators see that the real problem to be solved isn’t how to populate students’ notebooks with more information, it’s how to get them to lean in to wanting to do more work.”\\nChris Dede, a senior research fellow at Harvard University’s Graduate School of Education and a learning technology expert, said that though the gains presented in ASU’s study are relatively “modest,” they are “significant” nonetheless.\\n“It’s showing that it’s reasonable to develop other things based on similar approaches,” he said. “If humans are trained simply on knowing a bunch of facts and doing well on psychometric tests, they’re going to lose to AI in the workplace, because they’re doing what AI does well rather than what people do well.”\\nAnd what people do well, he said, “is make meaning out of complexity by pulling together different things they know about the world and developing hypotheses about what’s going on in the environment, which is not something AI can do, because it doesn’t understand the world.”\\nWant articles like this sent straight to your inbox?\\nSubscribe to a Newsletter\\nNext Story\\nOpinion\\nViews\\nWhere Is Congress?\\nBroad

Are They Ready to Use It?\\nBy Olina Banerji — April 08, 2025 7 min read\\nVladgrin/iStock/Getty\\nShare article\\nRemove Save to favorites Save to favorites\\nPrint\\nEmail Facebook LinkedIn Twitter Copy URL\\nThe number of districts that trained teachers on generative artificial intelligence more than doubled from 2023 to 2024, according to a new analysis by the research and policy firm RAND Corp.\\nIn the fall of 2024, 48 percent of districts reported they had trained teachers on AI use—up from 23 percent in the fall of 2023. RAND surveyed about 300 districts in 2024 and about 200 in 2023 and weighted their responses to make them representative of all public school districts.\\nIf districts follow their plans for the current school year, nearly three-quarters will have provided AI training to educators by the fall of 2025.\\nSee Also\\nSchool & District Management The Popularity of 4-Day School Weeks, in Charts As more schools adopt the shorter week, some opinions on the modified schedule might be surprising.\\nThis professional development has been slow to gain ground in schools. While generative AI became mainstream in late 2022 with the launch of ChatGPT, 7 in 10 teachers had not received any training on how to use AI in the classroom by spring 2024, according to a nationally representative survey from the EdWeek Research Center. By fall 2024, though, 43 percent of teachers said they had received at least one training session on AI, the EdWeek Research Center found.\\nBoth teachers and principals are increasingly using AI in their day-to-day work. While principals use AI tools for administrative tasks like making schedules, writing newsletters, or crunching large datasets, teachers are more likely to use AI to generate lesson plans, customize lessons for students who might learn at different speeds and levels, or even use it creatively—to emulate a historical or fictional character to teach a particular lesson, for instance.\\nEven so, most districts took a gradual approach to introducing their teachers to AI.\\nIn addition to fielding the surveys, RAND conducted in-depth interviews with 14 district leaders on how they crafted their AI trainings in 2024. Instead of jumping straight into AI tools and their use, district leaders focused first on tackling teachers’ concerns about the technology.\\nOf the 14 leaders interviewed, all but one said they encountered “negative views of AI and reported that some teachers view it as a threat to traditional teaching methods or a tool for student cheating,” according to the report.\\nDistrict leaders said they provided training on the fundamental workings of AI—and its limitations—to lower teachers’ anxiety, and “shift away from an antagonistic, cheating-centered mentality” about AI.\\nAmong the 14 districts, trainings varied in length and content—from daylong trainings to “bite-sized” content delivered through regular emails and newsletters. All but one district made such training voluntary.\\n“I am not trying to push AI with my people, but I am trying to give them the tools if they’re interested. I know that as [AI adoption] starts happening, it will grow organically and very quickly,” one district leader told RAND researchers.\\nDistrict leaders tend to craft their own training\\nThe district leaders interviewed by RAND preferred crafting their own trainings, rather than relying on outside experts, said Melissa Diliberti, an associate policy researcher at RAND and a lead author on the report, in an email.\\n“This do-it-yourself approach, though potentially employed to meet specific district needs, also reflects a scarcity of external experts who are capable of providing appropriate training,” Diliberti said.\\nOf the 14 district leaders interviewed, 11 took a DIY approach to crafting their own AI training. They pieced together different kinds of resources put out by tech companies like Google, as well as education organizations like Digital Promise and the International Society for Technology in Education.\\nHalf of the interviewees said they struggled to find training experts who were knowledgeable about using AI in an educational context.\\nA time and resource crunch also pushed district leaders to pull together their own training, in the absence of ready-to-use resources, the report stated. Professional development in AI jostles for space among several other competing PD priorities, which can affect the length and depth of such training, the district leaders said.\\nDistrict leaders also used their own “negative” experiences with AI trainings—where they were left overwhelmed—to streamline the training they offered so it addressed teachers’ immediate needs.\\nA suburban West Coast district, for instance, first introduced “play” sessions to alleviate teachers’ anxiety about AI, before gradually moving onto more instruction-based learning.\\nThe “play” approach, in this district and others, consisted of teachers experimenting with an AI chatbot or platform and getting the hang of what AI can do. There were more focused sessions, too, in which district leaders introduced tools like MagicSchool or ChatGPT to show teachers how to use them to plan lessons or generate differentiated content for students.\\nChris Chism, the superintendent of the Pearl school district in Mississippi who was not associated with the RAND report, also created his own AI training module for teachers. His training, too, emphasizes both experimenting with the technology, and showcasing more streamlined, direct uses for the classroom.\\nIn an interview with Education Week last July, Chism said he had created mini chatbots that deliver essential information to teachers about specific topics. One chatbot, for instance, can generate lesson plans aligned with the state’s standards.\\nWhile district leaders’ trainings may be more in tune with a teacher’s needs, Diliberti said the quality and what’s covered in these trainings could vary between districts.\\nThere’s an equity gap in AI training\\nDespite the overall surge in AI training, the RAND report shows that such training is unevenly distributed—compared to nearly 67 percent of low-poverty districts that have introduced AI training for teachers, only 39 percent of high-poverty districts were able to do the same.\\nRAND used districts’ plans to project what the training gap might look like in the fall of 2025. While nearly all low-poverty district would have trained teachers on AI use, only 6 in 10 high-poverty districts would have done so, if districts stick to their plans.\\nSchools in low-poverty districts are more likely to have the time and resources to experiment with AI tools and figure out how to use them well for instructional practice. It’s not a luxury that schools in high-poverty districts may have, said Diliberti.\\nThis gap in training, or guidance, on how to use AI persists among the principal group, too, according to a previous RAND report published in February. Thirteen percent of principals in the highest-poverty schools said they got guidance, versus about a quarter of principals in lower-poverty schools.\\n“Teachers in higher-poverty schools are less likely to use AI, [as are] principals in the highest-poverty schools. So that probably drives whether the school system or the school itself is like, ‘Oh, we really need to provide guidance,’” Julia Kaufman, a senior policy researcher at RAND and lead author of the February report, told Education Week at the time.\\nThe faster takeup of AI by teachers in low-poverty districts means that teachers and students in high-poverty ones won’t have the same opportunity to learn from AI tools, the report says.\\nThere are still no clear links between greater reliance on AI tools and higher-quality teaching or learning, Diliberti said.\\n“But to the degree that we anticipate this might be true, greater uptake of AI in historically advantaged school settings does raise concerns that the rollout of AI into schools could exacerbate longstanding fault lines of educational inequality,” Diliberti added.\\nThe report calls for more targeted funding by federal and state education agencies to high-poverty districts to procure model professional development in AI and cultivate connections to networks of experts.\\nThe report also suggested that districts with more experience in training teachers on AI should share their expertise with other districts through state and regional education networks.\\nThe surge in training notwithstanding, Diliberti said it’s still too early to figure how exactly AI might fit into a district’s PD schedule for the year.\\n“Evidence from our district leaders suggest that their trainings are in the very early stages. [They are] more focused on just getting teachers comfortable with AI tools,” Diliberti said. “Regular teacher training on whether and how to best incorporate specific AI tools into instructional practice may still be some time away.”\\nOlina Banerji\\nFollow Unfollow\\nStaff Writer,\\xa0 Education Week\\nOlina Banerji is a reporter for Education Week who covers school leadership.\\ntwitter\\nemail\\nlinkedin\\nMost Popular Stories\\nOpen image caption\\nClose image caption\\nErin Huff, a 24-year-old kindergarten teacher at Waverly Elementary in Illinois, pictured here on Dec. 18, 2019, says low pay, high stress, and heavy workloads often discourage young people from entering teacher preparation programs.

But what do these terms really mean for manufacturing operations, and how are they different from the machine learning many are already familiar with? This episode of Great Question: A Manufacturing Podcast cuts through the hype. Join New Equipment Digest Editor-in-Chief Laura Davis as she breaks down the distinctions between key AI types, explores how each is impacting areas like product design, quality control, smart factories, and logistics, and addresses the critical questions around implementation challenges and strategic adoption. Listen now to understand the real potential beyond the buzzwords.\\nBelow is an excerpt from the podcast:\\nThere's no doubt about it, artificial intelligence is really shaping this decade. It's popping up everywhere, across practically every industry, making things more convenient and opening doors we probably haven't even thought of yet. Now, for manufacturing, we've already seen huge leaps in efficiency thanks to Industry 4.0 and automation, right? Well, AI is really the next big wave. In fact, Tom Coshow over at Gartner predicts that by 2028, AI agents—not people—will be making about 15% of routine business decisions all on their own.\\nThat's a huge shift, especially for manufacturing. But to really grasp how AI will achieve this on the factory floor, we first need to get clear on what we mean by 'AI'. It's not just one thing. You've probably heard terms like 'Generative AI' and 'Agentic AI' thrown around, alongside the machine learning many are already familiar with. Let's break down what these different types are and how they fit into the manufacturing picture.\\nSo the big terms you keep hearing are Generative AI and Agentic AI. And it's important to know they're not the same thing.\\nBefore these newer types hit the headlines, many in manufacturing were already using AI, specifically machine learning. Think of machine learning as being focused mostly on prediction—it looks at data, finds patterns, and uses rules we give it to solve specific problems. You see it in predictive analytics, understanding language—that's natural language processing or NLP—and even some basic autonomous systems.\\nThen you have Generative AI. It also learns from data, but its main job is to create something new based on those patterns. This is the AI that writes text, generates images, maybe even composes music, or designs product models. Think ChatGPT, Claude, DALL-E, Midjourney—those tools that exploded onto the scene? That's Generative AI. It's great for mimicking human-like creative work and can be a real time-saver.\\nTom Coshow over at Gartner predicts that by 2028, AI agents—not people—will be making about 15% of routine business decisions all on their own.\\nNow, Agentic AI is built to interact with the world around it, make decisions, and actually do things to reach a goal—all by itself, no human constantly telling it what to do. That's a key difference from Generative AI, which usually needs a human prompt to get started.\\nFor Agentic AI, think about a self-driving car figuring out traffic based on its sensors, or a robot arm in a warehouse picking and sorting items on its own, or even a smart assistant that manages your calendar without you asking. These systems use sensors to 'see' or 'feel' their surroundings, algorithms to 'think,' and actuators to 'act'.\\nThe core idea with Agentic AI is that it has a goal. It doesn't just react; it considers its objectives and makes choices to get there. This is the type of AI people sometimes joke about taking over because it can act independently. That independence naturally brings up serious questions about ethics and accountability. Like, who's responsible if it messes up? How do we ensure it stays aligned with what we want it to do? Developers are definitely grappling with this, building in safeguards to keep things on track.\\nSo, another way to think about the difference is scope. Generative AI is usually focused on specific, well-defined creative tasks. Agentic AI often tackles bigger, more complex goals that might require multiple steps and constant adjustments along the way. The simple takeaway? Generative AI generates, Agentic AI acts.\\nKeep listening\\nSo, remember that key difference: Generative AI generates, Agentic AI acts. And often, as we'll see, they can even work together. With that foundation laid, let's explore the interesting part: what does this look like in practice today? Where is AI already making a tangible impact on the manufacturing floor?\\nWhen you start combining AI—whether it's machine learning, generative, or agentic—with things like computer vision or natural language processing, you can speed up process improvements like never before. One of its superpowers is crunching massive amounts of data. And I don't just mean looking at numbers—I mean digging through everything, finding hidden patterns, learning constantly, figuring out what it all means, and then telling you what to do next, or even doing it itself, often in seconds. Plus, it's adaptable. Because it's based on algorithms, it can react to changes happening right now—data pouring in from sensors, machines, maybe your whole production line.\\nAbout the PodcastGreat Question: A Manufacturing Podcast offers news and information for the people who make, store and move things and those who manage and maintain the facilities where that work gets done.

What’s changed is how Microsoft responds to a flop.\\nby Tom Warren\\nApr 4, 2025, 2:00 PM UTC\\n0 Comments / 0 New\\nTom Warren is a senior editor and author of Notepad, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.\\nIn 2005, Microsoft’s leaders were starting to get worried. Windows and Office were doing well, but the company’s lead software architect, Ray Ozzie, warned them that an emerging trend threatened Microsoft’s very existence.\\n“A new business model has emerged in the form of advertising-supported services and software,” warned Ozzie in his famous memo. “This model has the potential to fundamentally impact how we and other developers build, deliver, and monetize innovations.”\\nOzzie wanted Microsoft to get ready for the web-based world and cloud computing, fearing the company would otherwise be left behind. In the years after Ozzie’s memo, Google started to build an online competitor to Office with its Google Docs web service that it was selling to businesses and offering free to consumers. But the idea of moving Office to the cloud remained controversial internally. Doing so would upend Microsoft’s traditional method of selling software — and potentially eat into short-term profits in a big way.\\n“It was a gutsy call, it wasn’t a popular call at Microsoft at that time,” says Rajesh Jha, executive vice president of Microsoft’s experiences and devices group. Steve Ballmer, then Microsoft’s CEO, decided to go ahead with it, moving Office to the cloud and launching Azure fully in 2010.\\nRelated\\nThe 50 best things Microsoft has ever made\\nMicrosoft is now 50 years old\\nOffice 365 launched initially in beta, and Microsoft faced challenges transforming Office for the web. “The early days of Office 365 were rough,” admits Jha. Microsoft had to perform the painstaking transition of moving apps that were built for a different architecture and era to the cloud and make that scale properly. “I remember Steve [Ballmer] talking to me and saying ‘I’ve got your back, go fix this stuff.”\\nIt was the type of change that Microsoft has navigated time and time again over its 50-year history, an epoch marked by success, pivots, and failures. It’s easy to think Microsoft would be embarrassed by the launch of Windows 8, the performance of the Zune, and its failure in smartphones — surely, the company wishes those things had done better. But earnest attempts at something new are the whole point.\\n“We’re still around and leading things because we accept change,” says Steven Bathiche, head of Microsoft’s applied sciences group, in an interview with The Verge. “That’s the pearl about Microsoft that’s kind of unique with a company as old as ours, in an industry that changes as rapidly as ours.”\\nPhoto: Microsoft\\nMicrosoft turns 50 years old today. The company was founded in 1975 by Bill Gates and Paul Allen as Micro-Soft. A lot has changed since then, but in many ways, the company’s core business model and ethos remain the same: make software that everyone needs and get it installed everywhere.\\nGates and Allen began that strategy with Altair BASIC, a BASIC interpreter for the Altair 8800 — a computer made by MITS, rather than one they made themselves. After making an interpreter for one computer, they started bringing it to every other PC maker that would take them. Following the success of Microsoft BASIC, the company would repeat the strategy with MS-DOS, and eventually Windows and Office.\\nBut building those must-use platforms has taken a lot of experimentation, and Microsoft has often had the right idea at the wrong time — and missed out on major markets as a result.\\n”I’d come in as this mad scientist and show him all this cool stuff we were doing in hardware and software”\\nMicrosoft had SPOT smartwatches decades before the Apple Watch and Windows XP-powered tablet PCs years before the iPad. One of the company’s biggest misses was mobile. Microsoft has experimented with so much hardware and software over the years that it should have been in the ideal position to be the primary alternative to the iPhone. Instead, its platform burned out, and the company wasted billions on the acquisition of Nokia in a fruitless attempt to catch up.\\nStill, Microsoft insiders say it’s these experiments that have teed up many of the company’s eventual successes.\\n“We used to do these invention sessions with Bill [Gates] which was a lot of fun,” says Bathiche. “I was pretty young when Bill was around so I’d come in as this mad scientist and show him all this cool stuff we were doing in hardware and software, and I think he really appreciated that.”\\nSome of those experiments would unlock touch computing and cloud advances, helping pave the way for Microsoft’s own laptops and tablets. Other hardware and software experiments led to the Xbox, Microsoft’s best example of combining software and hardware into a successful consumer product. At its heart, Xbox is about enabling developers to build compelling games with software, and it was originally dubbed a “Windows entertainment project” and developed by members of Microsoft’s DirectX team to fend off the threat of Sony’s PS2 console in the living room.\\nOther Microsoft projects have taken a more roundabout route to becoming successful products. One major case that Bathiche mentions is Cortana, the voice assistant first designed for its phone platform. The assistant didn’t catch on as an alternative to Siri and Alexa and was eventually shut down.\\n“The Cortana days, that was really difficult,” admits Bathiche. The project required Microsoft to develop technologies around local compute and to optimize for Arm chips. “So that project, even though I kind of failed on enabling that sort of solution, I took all those technologies that we developed as a team and applied them to Windows and Surface.”\\nThose technologies, from optimizing Cortana to getting Windows Phone to run on Arm chips, helped with Microsoft’s work with the Surface Pro X and the early AI-powered experiences in Windows. “That’s going to set us up for the next decade,” says Bathiche.\\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella introducing the company’s Copilot Plus PC initiative.\\nImage: Allison Johnson / The Verge\\nThat history speaks to why Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has been so aggressive when it comes to AI.\\nOne of Microsoft’s most significant deals under Nadella has been its partnership with OpenAI. Microsoft originally invested $1 billion into OpenAI in 2019 to become the exclusive provider of cloud computing services to the AI research lab. It then extended that partnership in 2023 with an additional $10 billion investment, just months after ChatGPT launched and became the fastest-growing app in history.\\nThis investment has fueled Microsoft’s ongoing AI transformation, amid fears that Google was years ahead of it in scaling up AI efforts. For Bathiche, this new AI era illustrates patterns that allow companies like Microsoft to take advantage of the constant change in compute ability and build new experiences or new device form factors.\\n“When we had the first computers they would load a very specific program and that’s the only thing they could do,” says Bathiche. Microsoft saw the opportunity early on to build Windows as a way for developers to talk to PC hardware easily and create apps with a GUI on top. Then the internet was a layer on top of that, which changed how software could be delivered.\\n“The race is on to compile that piece of code uniquely, individually, for every person on the planet.”\\n“Now we’re on the next layer, which is the agent layer,” says Bathiche, describing intelligent software that acts autonomously on behalf of a user. “That’s the exciting one we’re trying to figure out.” Microsoft has always developed software by compiling an app like Word, and then everyone gets that same piece of software, whether it was delivered via a CD-ROM or over the internet. Microsoft is now trying to build software that adapts on the fly.\\n“The race is on to compile that piece of code uniquely, individually, for every person on the planet. The reason is that these AI agent experiences we’re talking about are really about deep personalization and understanding and customization,” says Bathiche.\\nThis push toward unique and personalized software through AI has driven compute needs like never before, and Microsoft’s Azure AI teams are constantly having to adapt to new models or new hardware that unlocks even more AI capabilities. We saw that recently with Microsoft’s quick adoption of DeepSeek’s R1 model into its Azure AI Foundry.\\n“All of the systems that we’ve built for 50 years need to apply to AI agents,” says Asha Sharma, corporate vice president of Microsoft’s AI platform. “For Azure AI Foundry we’re thinking about how we evolve to become the operating system on the backend of every single agent.”\\nMicrosoft envisions a world where AI agents will work alongside you as digital colleagues and collaborators. “I think a lot of the systems we’ve built for 50 years will be critical infrastructure for the digital workforce,” says Sharma. “We need to think about having not just human understandable interfaces, but machine understandable interfaces.”\\n“You go do fundamental research, you bring out a model, and then translate it into a real breakthrough feature”\\nPart of winning this AI battle will be down to Microsoft’s own models, and using competitor models wisely. Microsoft unveiled its own Muse AI model recently, which has been trained on the Xbox game Bleeding Edge to generate gameplay. Nadella stressed the importance of Microsoft’s own AI work during a recent employee town hall meeting, saying, “When I think about what we’re trying to do with Muse, that’s the bar. You go do fundamental research, you bring out a model, and then translate it into a real breakthrough feature in Copilot.”\\nBeyond digital colleagues and Xbox changes, Microsoft is also hinting at fundamental ways AI could live in the physical world. “I believe that some of our AI agents in the future will be embodied agents that are able to make plans and take actions on behalf of users in physical environments,” says Ashley Llorens, corporate vice president and managing director of Microsoft Research. “Not just the same very carefully engineered environments that we have many robots in today, but in many of the semi-structured environments that people live and work in. One of the challenges there is teaching AI how to reason over the relationships between objects and environments in time and space.”\\nAI-powered robots might sound like science fiction right now, but Microsoft is increasingly focused on robotics, healthcare, and even quantum computing, so anything seems possible for its next 50 years. Since Microsoft’s mobile miss, I’ve always gotten the feeling that the company is wary about missing the next big thing, so I’m fully expecting it to pivot if the AI era slows down.\\nMicrosoft’s resilience and its ability to predict what’s next — like Gates in the early days of Microsoft or Ozzie in 2005 — have defined the company’s existence over the past 50 years. Moments of potential demise have forced Microsoft to make big bets that weren’t always successful but did lead to change.\\nNow, Microsoft has gone all in on AI. Its efforts might even contribute to the “singularity,” a point in time when artificial intelligence exceeds the abilities of humans and, perhaps, even our control. What that will look like is anyone’s guess. But if the AI hype bubble bursts and it’s more a Windows Mobile flop than an Azure hit, I’m sure of one thing: Microsoft will adapt to meet the challenge.\\n0 Comments / 0 New\\nSee More:\\nMicrosoft\\nTech\\nFeatured Videos From The Verge\\nOpenAI has a Studio Ghibli problem | The Vergecast\\n1/1 Skip\\xa0Ad Continue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE\\nIn this episode, we do a Studio Ghibli-like rendition of The Vergecast.

After clawing back from pandemic-era enrollment declines, higher education faces a new wave of pressure: deliver more, with less—again.\\nElement451 believes that\\'s not just unsustainable—it\\'s unacceptable.\\xa0Today, the AI-first student engagement platform announced the launch of Bolt Agents, a first-of-its-kind AI workforce built for higher ed. Fully integrated into the Element451 CRM, Bolt Agents are proactive, goal-oriented teammates designed to support overextended staff—not replace them.\\nIn a moment defined by uncertainty, burnout, and resource constraints, Bolt Agents offer a resilient, flexible way for schools to meet growing demands while staying human-first. It\\'s how institutions can become #dogeproof—without sacrificing service or sanity.\\nPurpose-Built for the Pressures of Higher Ed\\nUnlike traditional AI tools that wait for a prompt, Bolt Agents act with intention.\\nEach agent is built for a specific job and can interpret data, personalize outreach, build communications, and execute across channels. They complete real projects from start to finish, delivering results—not just output.\\nAnd they do it in the platform, using the data, goals, and context already in Element451. There\\'s no third-party software to stitch together or babysit.\\nImagine this:\\nYou oversee enrollment at a large community college. Before heading out for a mid-summer break, you assign your Enrollment Agent a goal: get 500 newly admitted Health Sciences students registered for fall. When you return, the update\\'s waiting—537 students enrolled, questions answered, and no time lost.\\nOr you lead student success at a small liberal arts school. You ask your Academic Advisor Agent to re-engage first-year students who haven\\'t registered for the next term. Within days, nudges go out, support is delivered, and registration rates are rising—without pulling your team off other priorities.\\nStaff can review, edit, and approve the agent\\'s work—just like they would with a junior colleague. As trust builds, they delegate more, knowing oversight is always built in.\\nNot Just Automation—The Rise of the Hybrid Workforce\\nBolt Agents are part of a broader shift taking hold across industries: the hybrid workforce, where humans and AI work side by side. McKinsey predicts that generative and agentic AI could automate up to 30% of work hours in higher education by 2030, enabling staff to focus on more strategic, human-centered responsibilities.\\nBy offloading time-consuming tasks to AI teammates, institutions can redistribute workloads, avoid staff fatigue, and stay adaptive in the face of shifting policies and shrinking budgets. It\\'s a way to keep work moving—without stretching people too thin.\\nFlexible Support for Uncertain Times\\nHigher ed professionals have been overworked for too long. When peak seasons like orientation hit—or a team member is out—Bolt Agents step in without additional overhead, overtime, or frustration.\\n\"No other platform in higher ed can do this,\" said Ardis Kadiu, CEO of Element451. \"We\\'ve transformed AI from a feature into a teammate. Most AI is reactive—ours is proactive. It thinks, plans, acts, and improves, always guided by the goals of the institution and the people behind it.\"\\nThis is agentic AI—technology that reasons through goals and produces results, not just content. Gartner projects that 33% of enterprise apps will include agentic AI by 2028, up from less than 1% in 2024.\\nBolt Agents bring that future to higher ed today.\\nCome Build Your First Agent\\nBolt Agents are available now and already in use by Element451 partner institutions.\\nAt Element451\\'s Engage Summit in June, attendees will get hands-on experience with Bolt Agents—and the opportunity to build one tailored to their institution\\'s goals. It\\'s the fastest way to go from overwhelmed to operational, from task lists to outcomes.\\nIf higher ed is going to survive the next wave of uncertainty, it can\\'t keep asking humans to do it all.\\nRegister for the Summit\\xa0and see how AI can protect your team\\'s time and morale.\\nAbout Element451\\nElement451\\xa0is the AI-first CRM that gives colleges and universities a digital workforce to attract, enroll, and support today\\'s students. Schools can assign projects to Bolt Agents — AI teammates that can interpret data, write content, segment audiences, personalize outreach, and adjust tactics as they go. Staff stay in control while getting time back for the human work students value most. From prospect to post-graduation, Element451 helps schools connect with students in smarter, faster, and more personal ways.\\nPress Contact\\nBrandon Hurter\\nbrandon.hurter@element451.com\\nView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/higher-eds-ai-workforce-has-arrived-element451-introduces-bolt-agents-302421540.html\\nSOURCE Element451\\nMore in Markets\\nView All\\n### Morningstar’s Take on Tariffs: Stock Impacts, Portfolio Tips, and More What Trump’s tariff hikes mean for stocks, the economy, and global markets.

Nvidia is down 7.59%, TSMC is down 7.22%. In San Francisco, sources tell us that this isn’t a big deal. But in DC, people are panicking. The core question is whether GPUs – the graphics processing units that are crucial to AI computing and other industries – are exempted from Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs, and the answer is startlingly ambiguous.\\nInside AI labs, researchers expect that their industry will be granted a tariff exemption. “I fully expect this to be a situation where Trump again gives companies he views as important/on his side/whatever a hall pass,” similar to what the President did with Apple during his first term, one source inside a major AI lab told The Verge.\\nIn Washington, however, nobody seems sure what the current state of play is. The Trump administration spelled out an exception for the semiconductor chips at the heart of a GPU, but for now, complete electronic products that contain chips will apparently be subject to tariffs. And companies that need GPUs for machine learning, deep learning, real-time processing, and much more require not just the chip, but the entire machine built around it. “Most AI GPUs are, I believe, imported not as chips but as servers, largely from Taiwan,” Chris Miller, a professor at Tufts University and the author of Chip War: The Fight for the World’s Most Critical Technology, told The Verge in an email. “So these would presumably face the general Taiwan tariff rate” of 32%, currently scheduled to hit on April 9th.\\nOrdinarily, government agencies might be able to explain what’s happening. But when asked for clarity, a public affairs official at NIST, the agency at the Commerce Department overseeing the CHIPS Act – a $50 billion investment in building chip manufacturing plants on American soil – directed The Verge to the White House. The White House did not immediately return a request for comment. Neither did the U.S. Trade Representative, the agency responsible for creating and executing the President’s tariff strategy.\\nWhile the SF crowd is bullish on getting exemptions, tech lobbyists in Washington are closer to the chaos that is the second Trump administration, and are far too familiar with the president’s mercurial whims and vindictive nature, particularly against the tech industry. The fact that the tariffs are so vague and seem haphazardly thrown together – so haphazard, in fact, that there’s a legitimate argument that they were generated by AI – is only adding to their worries. “Everyone’s asking for clarity” from the administration, one lobbyist at a major tech company told The Verge. “So far, folks are saying that they think we’re okay, but not sure yet.” That’s not exactly a ringing vote of confidence for GPU tariff exemptions.\\nThe GPU confusion is rippling beyond the AI industry, hitting the Big Tech companies that stock thousands of these devices in datacenters across the country. Amazon, Google, and Microsoft all rely on access to GPUs to prop up their multi-billion dollar cloud architectures. Clearly, the market isn’t confident that their bottom line will weather these tariffs: The so-called “Magnificent Seven”, which includes the three companies above, have lost more than $1 trillion in market capitalization since the tariffs were announced. (Spokespeople for Google and Microsoft declined to comment for this story.)\\nThe AI industry has reason to think Trump might favor it in particular. Just a few months ago, OpenAI’s Sam Altman and other tech CEOs stood in the White House alongside the president to announce Stargate, a $500 billion datacenter infrastructure project devoted to fulfilling Altman’s demands for “more compute.” The current unclear state of GPUs coupled with the unpredictability of Trump’s tariffs in general, however, could shake their confidence — or at least mean they must renew attempts to curry Trump’s favor.\\n“If the tariffs are unchanged, we should prepare for a significant increase in the price of electronics.”\\nGPU juggernaut Nvidia has apparently begun moving manufacturing to the US, which it hopes will help insulate it from the tariffs. Reuters reported last December, for instance, that it was finalizing plans to produce its Blackwell AI GPU chip at TSMC’s Arizona plant, which aims to start fabricating chips this year. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang alluded to this partnership in a recent investor Q&A: “We’re manufacturing in so many different places. We could shift things around. Tariffs will have a little impact for us short term. Long term, we’re going to have manufacturing onshore.”\\nThe same can’t be said for compute-hungry AI labs, hyperscale cloud providers, or even average PC builders — all of whom might end up paying substantially more for GPUs. “None of this is impossible, but trying to produce every segment of electronics supply chains domestically will produce a staggering increase in cost, especially in the short-term, given that some of the capabilities simply don’t exist domestically,” Miller said. That doesn’t even take into account the tariffs on the raw materials needed to build these machines and plants, or any retaliatory measures: on Friday, for instance, China announced a new set of export restrictions on rare earth minerals, which are crucial for electronics manufacturing. The U.S. currently imports 90 percent of its rare earth minerals from China.\\n“If the tariffs are unchanged,” Miller added, “we should prepare for a significant increase in the price of electronics.”\\nBut ultimately, fealty to Trump might be more crucial than an appeal to reason. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has pledged allegiance to the new administration, which is important for Anthropic, since it sources some of its compute through Amazon. These deals are fragile, though. A single critical story in Bezos’ paper The Washington Post could lose Amazon (and by association, Anthropic) a tariff exemption, for instance. Anthropic also sources some of its compute through Google; along with Bezos, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai joined the gaggle of tech billionaires behind Trump at his inauguration.\\nAnd there are other factors that could indirectly cause problems for these companies, of course — like the US being pushed into a recession that devastates the tech economy. “The second order effects of the tariffs could still be bad,” the AI lab source added.\\nThe market tumbles seemed to have mobilized tech leaders. A group of tech CEOs and finance leaders are on their way to Trump’s private resort, Mar-a-Lago, according to journalist Kara Swisher. The goal seems to be to find some sense in these tariffs — and perhaps some exemptions.\\n13 Comments / 13 New\\nSee More:\\nAI\\nBusiness\\nNvidia\\nPolicy\\nPolitics\\nTech\\nMore in this stream\\nSee all\\n‘Hands Off’: Protesters deliver a sweeping message to Trump and Musk at a DC rally\\nLauren FeinerAn hour ago0\\nTrump’s tariffs killed his TikTok deal\\nAlex HeathApr 519\\nDOGE staffers are listed in the FCC directory\\nLauren FeinerApr 59\\nMost Popular\\nMost Popular\\nMicrosoft has created an AI-generated version of Quake\\nMicrosoft employee disrupts 50th anniversary and calls AI boss ‘war profiteer’\\nMicrosoft CEOs interrupted by another employee protestor: ‘shame on all of you’\\n‘Views’ are lies\\nTrump’s new tariff math looks a lot like ChatGPT’s\\nInstaller\\nA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.\\nEmail (required)\\nSign Up\\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

And they might be an important frontier for higher education in 2025, according to Ardis Kadiu, founder of ed-tech company Element451.\\nSpeaking to attendees at the ASU+GSV Summit AI Show on April 6, Kadiu said students increasingly expect intelligent, personalized experiences from their institutions that traditional staffing simply can’t provide. Kadiu cited author and journalist Jeff Selingo in pointing out that students can wait two to six weeks for appointments with mental health services and up to two and a half hours for financial aid assistance, but they want those experiences to be efficient and personal.\\n“This avalanche is coming in, and more support is needed,” Kadiu said. “AI can really bridge that gap.”\\nIn 2012, he said, AI was about perceiving the world around us, through functions such as speech recognition and image identification, with common applications in translation and medical imaging. The next big jump was in late 2022 with generative AI, which creates content rather than just analyzing it. In 2025, Kadiu said, agentic AI takes action rather than only responding to real-time prompts to generate content.\\nThat means there are new opportunities to use AI not just as a tool, but as a teammate, and Kadiu predicted that early adopters will have a competitive advantage. Through live demonstrations, he showed his audience a variety of uses for AI agents in higher education, from admissions counseling to campaign strategizing.\\nKadiu's company, Element451, is one of many offering AI agent services for higher education. On the surface, some of these services may resemble generative AI systems that users are more familiar with, but behind the scenes, they involve a system of AI agents working together, similar to how human staff would.\\nKadiu said AI agents are specialized with a skill type, a goal, a communication style and a set of actions it can take, like initiating an email or phone call. While the agent can take action on its own, it also has a set of “approvers” linked to it who OK each action before it takes place.\\nFor example, a recruiting agent might have the overall goal of getting a student to apply to a university. It will use existing university data systems to determine the best time for outreach, then create an email, SMS message, phone call or WhatsApp message. If that action is approved, the agent will store a transcript of the outreach plus any questions it fields in the student’s file, which the agent will use to inform human staff as well as its next course of action.\\n“We can just give the goal and provide all the tools and let the AI reason about it, and because it's built on all of the context and the data and all the prior conversations, it's probably the best way to kind of bring all those pieces together and not miss anything, right?” Kadiu said. “Imagine that you have to go from person to person, or that you have to see 500 students. It’s impossible to keep all their context in your head.”\\nIn the live demonstration, when Element451’s Vice President of Product Eric Range told an agent named Carolyn that he was ready to apply to the fictional Element University’s nursing program, Carolyn sent him a link to the application in real time.\\nAnother use case might be for financial aid help, especially with recent Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) hiccups. Kadiu said the Element451 financial aid agent is trained on studentaid.gov resources, and institutions can input their own resources as well. Specializing the agents means that one chatbot doesn’t need to know everything about the university, it just needs to know what the other agents do.\\n“They can hand things off to each other, just like a real human team would on the support channel,” Kadiu said.\\nFor example, when Range used a chatbot to ask about scholarships, a financial aid agent named Finley answered his questions. When he moved on to questions about athletic scholarships and asked how to try out for the soccer team, Finley passed him to a different agent specializing in athletics named Coach Carter.\\nOutside of community-facing communications, the reasoning abilities of AI agents can make them helpful for things like application management. Kadiu showed off an agent that evaluated applications based on a given criteria and gave a preliminary score.\\n“It’s making references to the documents: ‘Shows a GPA of 3.7, which places them above the 3.5 threshold. However, none of the provided documents include evidence of at least three AP honors courses,’ and that was part of the criteria,” Kadiu said.\\nThe agent also assessed the application for fraud.\\nIn the future, Kadiu said, AI agents could be added to course management systems to provide personalized interventions for students based on criteria like not attending class or missing assignments. But there are limits to what he will ask AI agents to do.\\n“We made a clear delineation in the sand, so to speak, around, ‘Hey, we don’t want to mess around with the class pedagogy right now,’” he said.\\nFacebook\\nLinkedIn\\nTwitter\\nPrint\\nEmail\\nTags:\\nArtificial Intelligence Higher EducationEducationASU+GSV\\nAbby Sourwine\\nAbby Sourwine is a staff writer for the Center for Digital Education.

But what do these terms really mean for manufacturing operations, and how are they different from the machine learning many are already familiar with? This episode of Great Question: A Manufacturing Podcast cuts through the hype. Join New Equipment Digest Editor-in-Chief Laura Davis as she breaks down the distinctions between key AI types, explores how each is impacting areas like product design, quality control, smart factories, and logistics, and addresses the critical questions around implementation challenges and strategic adoption. Listen now to understand the real potential beyond the buzzwords.\\nBelow is an excerpt from the podcast:\\nThere's no doubt about it, artificial intelligence is really shaping this decade. It's popping up everywhere, across practically every industry, making things more convenient and opening doors we probably haven't even thought of yet. Now, for manufacturing, we've already seen huge leaps in efficiency thanks to Industry 4.0 and automation, right? Well, AI is really the next big wave. In fact, Tom Coshow over at Gartner predicts that by 2028, AI agents—not people—will be making about 15% of routine business decisions all on their own.\\nThat's a huge shift, especially for manufacturing. But to really grasp how AI will achieve this on the factory floor, we first need to get clear on what we mean by 'AI'. It's not just one thing. You've probably heard terms like 'Generative AI' and 'Agentic AI' thrown around, alongside the machine learning many are already familiar with. Let's break down what these different types are and how they fit into the manufacturing picture.\\nSo the big terms you keep hearing are Generative AI and Agentic AI. And it's important to know they're not the same thing.\\nBefore these newer types hit the headlines, many in manufacturing were already using AI, specifically machine learning. Think of machine learning as being focused mostly on prediction—it looks at data, finds patterns, and uses rules we give it to solve specific problems. You see it in predictive analytics, understanding language—that's natural language processing or NLP—and even some basic autonomous systems.\\nThen you have Generative AI. It also learns from data, but its main job is to create something new based on those patterns. This is the AI that writes text, generates images, maybe even composes music, or designs product models. Think ChatGPT, Claude, DALL-E, Midjourney—those tools that exploded onto the scene? That's Generative AI. It's great for mimicking human-like creative work and can be a real time-saver.\\nTom Coshow over at Gartner predicts that by 2028, AI agents—not people—will be making about 15% of routine business decisions all on their own.\\nNow, Agentic AI is built to interact with the world around it, make decisions, and actually do things to reach a goal—all by itself, no human constantly telling it what to do. That's a key difference from Generative AI, which usually needs a human prompt to get started.\\nFor Agentic AI, think about a self-driving car figuring out traffic based on its sensors, or a robot arm in a warehouse picking and sorting items on its own, or even a smart assistant that manages your calendar without you asking. These systems use sensors to 'see' or 'feel' their surroundings, algorithms to 'think,' and actuators to 'act'.\\nThe core idea with Agentic AI is that it has a goal. It doesn't just react; it considers its objectives and makes choices to get there. This is the type of AI people sometimes joke about taking over because it can act independently. That independence naturally brings up serious questions about ethics and accountability. Like, who's responsible if it messes up? How do we ensure it stays aligned with what we want it to do? Developers are definitely grappling with this, building in safeguards to keep things on track.\\nSo, another way to think about the difference is scope. Generative AI is usually focused on specific, well-defined creative tasks. Agentic AI often tackles bigger, more complex goals that might require multiple steps and constant adjustments along the way. The simple takeaway? Generative AI generates, Agentic AI acts.\\nKeep listening\\nSo, remember that key difference: Generative AI generates, Agentic AI acts. And often, as we'll see, they can even work together. With that foundation laid, let's explore the interesting part: what does this look like in practice today? Where is AI already making a tangible impact on the manufacturing floor?\\nWhen you start combining AI—whether it's machine learning, generative, or agentic—with things like computer vision or natural language processing, you can speed up process improvements like never before. One of its superpowers is crunching massive amounts of data. And I don't just mean looking at numbers—I mean digging through everything, finding hidden patterns, learning constantly, figuring out what it all means, and then telling you what to do next, or even doing it itself, often in seconds. Plus, it's adaptable. Because it's based on algorithms, it can react to changes happening right now—data pouring in from sensors, machines, maybe your whole production line.\\nAbout the PodcastGreat Question: A Manufacturing Podcast offers news and information for the people who make, store and move things and those who manage and maintain the facilities where that work gets done.

After clawing back from pandemic-era enrollment declines, higher education faces a new wave of pressure: deliver more, with less—again.\\nElement451 believes that\\'s not just unsustainable—it\\'s unacceptable.\\xa0Today, the AI-first student engagement platform announced the launch of Bolt Agents, a first-of-its-kind AI workforce built for higher ed. Fully integrated into the Element451 CRM, Bolt Agents are proactive, goal-oriented teammates designed to support overextended staff—not replace them.\\nIn a moment defined by uncertainty, burnout, and resource constraints, Bolt Agents offer a resilient, flexible way for schools to meet growing demands while staying human-first. It\\'s how institutions can become #dogeproof—without sacrificing service or sanity.\\nPurpose-Built for the Pressures of Higher Ed\\nUnlike traditional AI tools that wait for a prompt, Bolt Agents act with intention.\\nEach agent is built for a specific job and can interpret data, personalize outreach, build communications, and execute across channels. They complete real projects from start to finish, delivering results—not just output.\\nAnd they do it in the platform, using the data, goals, and context already in Element451. There\\'s no third-party software to stitch together or babysit.\\nImagine this:\\nYou oversee enrollment at a large community college. Before heading out for a mid-summer break, you assign your Enrollment Agent a goal: get 500 newly admitted Health Sciences students registered for fall. When you return, the update\\'s waiting—537 students enrolled, questions answered, and no time lost.\\nOr you lead student success at a small liberal arts school. You ask your Academic Advisor Agent to re-engage first-year students who haven\\'t registered for the next term. Within days, nudges go out, support is delivered, and registration rates are rising—without pulling your team off other priorities.\\nStaff can review, edit, and approve the agent\\'s work—just like they would with a junior colleague. As trust builds, they delegate more, knowing oversight is always built in.\\nNot Just Automation—The Rise of the Hybrid Workforce\\nBolt Agents are part of a broader shift taking hold across industries: the hybrid workforce, where humans and AI work side by side. McKinsey predicts that generative and agentic AI could automate up to 30% of work hours in higher education by 2030, enabling staff to focus on more strategic, human-centered responsibilities.\\nBy offloading time-consuming tasks to AI teammates, institutions can redistribute workloads, avoid staff fatigue, and stay adaptive in the face of shifting policies and shrinking budgets. It\\'s a way to keep work moving—without stretching people too thin.\\nFlexible Support for Uncertain Times\\nHigher ed professionals have been overworked for too long. When peak seasons like orientation hit—or a team member is out—Bolt Agents step in without additional overhead, overtime, or frustration.\\n\"No other platform in higher ed can do this,\" said Ardis Kadiu, CEO of Element451. \"We\\'ve transformed AI from a feature into a teammate. Most AI is reactive—ours is proactive. It thinks, plans, acts, and improves, always guided by the goals of the institution and the people behind it.\"\\nThis is agentic AI—technology that reasons through goals and produces results, not just content. Gartner projects that 33% of enterprise apps will include agentic AI by 2028, up from less than 1% in 2024.\\nBolt Agents bring that future to higher ed today.\\nCome Build Your First Agent\\nBolt Agents are available now and already in use by Element451 partner institutions.\\nAt Element451\\'s Engage Summit in June, attendees will get hands-on experience with Bolt Agents—and the opportunity to build one tailored to their institution\\'s goals. It\\'s the fastest way to go from overwhelmed to operational, from task lists to outcomes.\\nIf higher ed is going to survive the next wave of uncertainty, it can\\'t keep asking humans to do it all.\\nRegister for the Summit\\xa0and see how AI can protect your team\\'s time and morale.\\nAbout Element451\\nElement451\\xa0is the AI-first CRM that gives colleges and universities a digital workforce to attract, enroll, and support today\\'s students. Schools can assign projects to Bolt Agents — AI teammates that can interpret data, write content, segment audiences, personalize outreach, and adjust tactics as they go. Staff stay in control while getting time back for the human work students value most. From prospect to post-graduation, Element451 helps schools connect with students in smarter, faster, and more personal ways.\\nPress Contact\\nBrandon Hurter\\nbrandon.hurter@element451.com\\nView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/higher-eds-ai-workforce-has-arrived-element451-introduces-bolt-agents-302421540.html\\nSOURCE Element451\\nMore in Markets\\nView All\\n### Morningstar’s Take on Tariffs: Stock Impacts, Portfolio Tips, and More What Trump’s tariff hikes mean for stocks, the economy, and global markets.

With agentic AI, the \"standards went up fast,\" Jonathan Userovici, general partner at VC firm Headline, told Business Insider.\\n\"Investors don\\'t just want to be impressed — they want to be educated, convinced, and excited. Your deck has to do all three,\" he said.\\nBI examined the pitch decks used by founders of five agentic AI startups to gauge what makes a successful presentation.\\nHere are three things the decks had in common — and what investors think would make a standout slideshow.\\nHighlight a community and network of supporters and users\\nBreakout\\nHaving a stamp of approval from advisors from top companies gives investors another avenue to conduct their due diligence and suggests the product is trusted and used by industry heavyweights.\\nBreakout, a startup that has launched AI sales agents, clearly outlines some key figures backing its mission in its deck. With $3.25 million in fresh funding under its belt, the company is looking to manage software companies\\' inbound sales.\\nOptimHire\\nSimilarly, OptimHire, a startup replacing recruiters with AI agents, showcased the agencies it has matched its product with — highlighting a strong product-market fit.

It goes on to outline solutions to the issue in a deck that helped it bag $3.1 million in seed funding in November 2024.\\nDeckmatch\\nThis slide exemplifies three ways in which the startup would combat the issue of unstructured data and how its platform could be integrated into the likes of email and WhatsApp.\\nOptimHire\\nSimilarly, OptimHire also pointed to tangible ways in which its platform has served its users — by cutting the number of hours needed to screen profiles and schedule interviews.\\nShow retention and budget replacement\\nAuxia\\nRevenue and pricing metrics are a key staple in any good pitch deck — but startups should clarify the long-term value-add their platform presents.\\nUserovici says retention is the new annual recurring revenue, or ARR.\\n\"Many AI apps, especially the \\'prosumer\\' ones, spike immediately as users rush to try them,\" said Userovici, referring to individuals who consume and produce. \"The world is full of flashy demos; retention is your proof of reality. Great decks lean into that.\"\\nAuxia, a startup that\\'s developed an AI agent for marketing and sales, raised a combined funding round totaling $23.5 million in March.\\nIts deck highlighted its consistent growth trajectory over nine months, showcasing how the product is retained beyond an initial use case.\\nGenie AI\\nGenie AI, a legal tech startup that\\'s built an AI agent for law firms, raised nearly $18 million in a round led by Google Ventures in October 2024.\\nIts pitch deck not only demonstrates strong customer retention but also explains how its platform offers strategic value to companies — something investors are keen to see in decks.\\nGenie AI\\n\"We\\'re seeing a shift in pricing as well. Winning AI founders price like they\\'re replacing a budget — not just selling a tool. Show us the math behind it,\" Userovici told BI.\\n\"Anchor it to value, savings, or new revenue. Highlight what you replace, not just what you add,\" he added. \"Show us which outsourced services, tools, or vendors you\\'re eliminating. In a way, traditional SaaS was sold to the CIO.

The record fundraising and the goal of capitalizing on foreign investment interest in the U.S. tech industry come against the backdrop of a sweeping tariff plan by President Donald Trump to urge companies to manufacture goods in the U.S.\\nTo raise such a large amount of capital, a16z has been pitching it around the world. International LPs see the fund as a way to invest their money more easily into American AI companies without restrictions, one of the sources said.\\nAndreessen Horowitz did not reply to requests for comment.\\nA16z's founders, venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, announced last year they would support Trump, breaking with their traditional support for Democratic candidates, a sentiment shared by other prominent Silicon Valley figures such as Elon Musk.\\nEven by the standards of a firm known for raising some of Silicon Valley's largest investment vehicles, the new fund would represent a colossal step up in scale. It would test LPs' interest in venture capital amid global economic turmoil and continue the debate over how scalable this asset class is while maintaining appealing returns.\\nIf successfully raised, the new megafund would be surpassed only by SoftBank's two Vision funds, a massive experiment by deploying unprecedented amounts of capital into the tech sector, which has yielded mixed results. SoftBank Vision Fund 1, launched in 2017, was a record-breaking $100 billion fund, while its successor, Vision Fund 2, manages about $56 billion from SoftBank's balance sheet. Another Silicon Valley venture capital firm, Sequoia Capital, has over $56 billion in assets under management across multiple funds, with its evergreen fund growing to $19.6 billion this year, according to filings.\\nA16z's largest fund to date is a $5 billion growth-stage fund it raised as part of a $9 billion fundraise it announced in early 2022. It similarly asked LPs to commit capital into a grab bag of funds, each focused on a different sector or stage of startup maturity, to secure a $7.2 billion haul in 2024, $3.75 billion for a growth fund.\\nThe new fund, in its early stage, could take several months to close. Some LPs are drawn to the performance of its previous large funds, including one dedicated to cryptocurrency investments, as well as a16z's close ties with the Trump administration, one source said.\\nA sizable chunk of the capital would be set aside for follow-on investments into AI companies in the firm's portfolio, one source told Reuters. A16z was an early backer in some of today's hottest AI companies including Databricks and Musk's xAI, and has continued to participate in their multibillion-dollar growth-stage fundraising rounds.\\nThe firm is asking LPs to back a single vehicle instead of several across different sectors, underscoring both venture capitalists' obsession with artificial intelligence, and the massive capital demands of companies — in particular among those building large language models that require major amounts of computing power and data.\\nA16z has already been aggressive in backing numerous companies in the field, participating billion-dollar funding rounds as a lead investor in AI model developer startups including xAI, Safe Superintelligence and France-based Mistral. It has also purchased shares of OpenAI through a tender offer in the secondary transaction market.\\nFounded in 2009, a16z announced itself with a loud attitude and ambitions to disrupt the venture capital industry by going bigger. It raised funds larger than the industry norm and outbid traditional blue-chip investors to win stakes in promising startups, further sweetening the deal by hiring a legion of staff to provide support for those companies.\\nThe first $300 million fund was considered an enormous debut fund at the time. A16z now manages $45 billion of assets under management, according to its website. It became a registered investment advisor in 2019, gaining more flexibility in investment style beyond the traditional VC. The firm runs several sector-specific funds that invest in categories such as biotechnology, cryptocurrency and defense tech.\\nFor AI companies, it recently put together a cluster of thousands of Nvidia's GPUs that it advertised for rent to startups in its investment portfolio that might otherwise have difficulty securing access to the chips.\\n(Reporting by Kenrick Cai and Anna Tong in San Francisco and Krystal Hu in New York; Editing by Kenneth Li and Matthew Lewis)\\nRecommended Stories\\nSign in to access your portfolio\"}, {'title': \"Here's an exclusive look at the pitch deck AI tax startup Incentify used to raise $9.5 million - Business Insider\", 'image_url': 'https://cdn.sanity.io/images/0vv8moc6/mhe/7ba06c5ebddbf0f0a5f5d77db6fa76b35231ff4c-7721x3712.jpg?rect=0,0,3640,3712&fit=crop&auto=format', 'raw_content': 'Published Time: 2025-04-02T12:00:02Z\\nHere\\'s the Pitch Deck AI Tax Startup Incentify Used to Raise $9.5M - Business Insider\\nSubscribe Newsletters\\nDow Jones +0.56% Nasdaq +0.75% S&P 500 +0.67% AAPL +0.27% NVDA +0.79% MSFT +0.1% AMZN +1.87% META +0.06% TSLA +4.38%\\nDow Jones +0.56% Nasdaq +0.75% S&P 500 +0.67% AAPL +0.27% NVDA +0.79% MSFT +0.1% AMZN +1.87% META +0.06% TSLA +4.38%\\nSearch\\nBusiness\\nStrategy\\nEconomy\\nFinance\\nRetail\\nAdvertising\\nCareers\\nMedia\\nReal Estate\\nSmall Business\\nThe Better Work Project\\nTech\\nScience\\nAI\\nEnterprise\\nTransportation\\nStartups\\nInnovation\\nMarkets\\nStocks\\nIndices\\nCommodities\\nCrypto\\nCurrencies\\nETFs\\nLifestyle\\nEntertainment\\nCulture\\nTravel\\nFood\\nHealth\\nParenting\\nReviews\\nTech\\nStreaming\\nTickets\\nHome\\nKitchen\\nStyle\\nBeauty\\nGifts\\nDeals\\nPolitics\\nMilitary & Defense\\nLaw\\nEducation\\nPersonal Finance\\nBanking\\nSavings\\nBest Savings Accounts\\nRaisin Review\\nChecking Accounts\\nBest Checking Accounts\\nChime Checking Account\\nSoFi Checking and Saving\\nBest Money Market Accounts\\nCDs\\nBest CD Rates\\nBest Bank Account Bonuses\\nCash Back Debit Cards\\nBest Banks\\nCIT Bank Review\\nUFB Direct Bank\\nSmall Business Banking\\nCredit Cards\\nCredit Scores\\nCredit Monitoring\\nBest Credit Cards\\nBest Cash Back Credit Cards\\nBest Rewards Credit Cards\\nBest Travel Credit Cards\\nBest 0% APR Credit Cards\\nBest Balance Transfer Credit Cards\\nBest First Credit Cards\\nBest Business Credit Cards\\nDiscover it Cash Back Credit Card\\nChase Sapphire Preferred Credit Card\\nInvesting\\nFinancial Planning\\nRetirement\\nTaxes\\nLoans\\nBest personal loans\\nBest debt consolidation loans\\nBest Loans for Bad Credit\\nStudent Loans\\nBest Student Loans\\nBest Student Loan Refinance\\nMortgages\\nBest mortgage lenders\\nBest mortgage refinance lenders\\nBest FHA Lenders\\nBest HELOC Lenders\\nInsurance\\nBest Car Insurance\\nHomeowners Insurance\\nBest Homeowners Insurance\\nBest Renters Insurance\\nLife Insurance\\nBest Life Insurance\\nPet Insurance\\nBest Pet Insurance\\nTravel Insurance\\nBest Travel Insurance\\nSquareMouth Travel Insurance\\nIdentity Theft Protection\\nVideo\\nBig Business\\nFood Wars\\nSo Expensive\\nStill Standing\\nBoot Camp\\nSubscribe\\nMy account\\nLog in\\nNewsletters\\nUS edition\\nDeutschland & Österreich\\nEspaña\\nJapan\\nNetherlands\\nPolska\\nGet the app\\nStartups\\nHere\\'s an exclusive look at the pitch deck AI tax startup Incentify used to raise $9.5 million\\nBy Samantha Stokes\\nIncentify CEO Laurence Sotsky Incentify\\nApr 2, 2025, 12:00 PM UTC\\nShare\\nFacebook Email X LinkedIn Copy link\\nSave Saved Read in app\\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers.

Consulting firm Ryan LLC and Gary Gilbert, who co-founded RocketMortgage and co-owns the Cleveland Cavaliers, also participated in the round.\\nFounded in 2019, Los Angeles-based Incentify offers software that helps companies manage their tax credits and incentives (C&I). The startup uses AI to find applicable benefits based on a company\\'s background and location, and it manages the application process and timeline for a company\\'s entire C&I portfolio.\\nIncentify previously raised $4.25 million in 2020, and its clients include KPMG, Amazon, Cargill, and investor Ryan LLC.\\nIncentify CEO Laurence Sotsky said that adding AI to the platform — namely, Incentify\\'s Explore tool, which is where companies get personalized tax incentives — has helped the startup supercharge its business.\\n\"To create Explore, we compiled every federal, state, and local grant, credit, abatement, and incentive into a massive data warehouse,\" he said. \"We then trained our AI model on this vast dataset, enabling us to deliver unparalleled insights and rich content to our customers.\"\\nSotksy added that Incentify\\'s business model was a tough sell for some VCs during the fundraising process.

REUTERS/ Mike Blake/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tab\\nSummary\\nCompanies\\nA16z seeks $20 billion for AI-focused growth-stage investments\\nFundraising leverages ties to Trump, appealing to international LPs\\nA16z's AI investments include xAI, Databricks and OpenAI\\nSAN FRANCISCO, April 8 - Venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz is seeking to raise about $20 billion in what will be the largest fund in its history, to capitalize on global investors' interest in backing U.S. artificial intelligence companies, sources told Reuters.\\nThe tech investment firm, known informally as a16z, has told limited partners that the fund will be dedicated to growth-stage investments in AI companies and draw upon global investors keen on investing in American companies, the sources said. The record fundraising and the goal of capitalizing on foreign investment interest in the U.S. tech industry come against the backdrop of a sweeping tariff plan by President Donald Trump to urge companies to manufacture goods in the U.S.\\nThe Reuters Tariff Watch newsletter is your daily guide to the latest global trade and tariff news. Sign up here.\\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\\nTo raise such a large amount of capital, a16z has been pitching it around the world. International LPs see the fund as a way to invest their money more easily into American AI companies without restrictions, one of the sources said.\\nAndreessen Horowitz did not reply to requests for comment.\\nA16z's founders, venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, announced last year they would support Trump, breaking with their traditional support for Democratic candidates, a sentiment shared by other prominent Silicon Valley figures such as Elon Musk.\\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\\nEven by the standards of a firm known for raising some of Silicon Valley's largest investment vehicles, the new fund would represent a colossal step up in scale. It would test LPs' interest in venture capital amid global economic turmoil and continue the debate over how scalable this asset class is while maintaining appealing returns.\\nIf successfully raised, the new megafund would be surpassed only by SoftBank's (9984.T), opens new tab two Vision funds, a massive experiment by deploying unprecedented amounts of capital into the tech sector, which has yielded mixed results. SoftBank Vision Fund 1, launched in 2017, was a record-breaking $100 billion fund, while its successor, Vision Fund 2, manages about $56 billion from SoftBank's balance sheet. Another Silicon Valley venture capital firm, Sequoia Capital, has over $56 billion in assets under management across multiple funds, with its evergreen fund growing to $19.6 billion this year, according to filings.\\nA16z's largest fund to date is a $5 billion growth-stage fund it raised as part of a $9 billion fundraise it announced in early 2022. It similarly asked LPs to commit capital into a grab bag of funds, each focused on a different sector or stage of startup maturity, to secure a $7.2 billion haul in 2024, $3.75 billion for a growth fund.\\nThe new fund, in its early stage, could take several months to close. Some LPs are drawn to the performance of its previous large funds, including one dedicated to cryptocurrency investments, as well as a16z's close ties with the Trump administration, one source said.\\nA sizable chunk of the capital would be set aside for follow-on investments into AI companies in the firm's portfolio, one source told Reuters. A16z was an early backer in some of today's hottest AI companies including Databricks and Musk's xAI, and has continued to participate in their multibillion-dollar growth-stage fundraising rounds.\\nThe firm is asking LPs to back a single vehicle instead of several across different sectors, underscoring both venture capitalists' obsession with artificial intelligence, and the massive capital demands of companies — in particular among those building large language models that require major amounts of computing power and data.\\nA16z has already been aggressive in backing numerous companies in the field, participating billion-dollar funding rounds as a lead investor in AI model developer startups including xAI, Safe Superintelligence and France-based Mistral. It has also purchased shares of OpenAI through a tender offer in the secondary transaction market.\\nFounded in 2009, a16z announced itself with a loud attitude and ambitions to disrupt the venture capital industry by going bigger. It raised funds larger than the industry norm and outbid traditional blue-chip investors to win stakes in promising startups, further sweetening the deal by hiring a legion of staff to provide support for those companies.\\nThe first $300 million fund was considered an enormous debut fund at the time. A16z now manages $45 billion of assets under management, according to its website. It became a registered investment advisor in 2019, gaining more flexibility in investment style beyond the traditional VC. The firm runs several sector-specific funds that invest in categories such as biotechnology, cryptocurrency and defense tech.\\nFor AI companies, it recently put together a cluster of thousands of Nvidia's (NVDA.O), opens new tab GPUs that it advertised for rent to startups in its investment portfolio that might otherwise have difficulty securing access to the chips.\\nReporting by Kenrick Cai and Anna Tong in San Francisco and Krystal Hu in New York; Editing by Kenneth Li and Matthew Lewis\\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tab\\nSuggested Topics:\\nArtificial Intelligence\\nPurchase Licensing Rights\\nKrystal HuThomson Reuters\\nKrystal reports on venture capital and startups for Reuters.

Today, more venture firms are adopting data-driven strategies in addition to, or sometimes even instead of, traditional VC methods that often rely on networking.\\nIndeed, several venture firms today claim they use AI to source deals, and we even have some private markets-focused companies that sell analytical tools to help all kinds of investors to do “qualitative diligence.”\\nStill, Farmer feels SignalFire’s approach is unique because, unlike other VCs that use data, his firm integrates AI into every aspect of the investing process — from identifying promising early-stage startups to helping portfolio companies with recruiting and product marketing.\\nAnd its limited partners seem to agree that its investment methods will continue to hone its edge. On Monday, SignalFire said that it has secured more than $1 billion in fresh capital, bringing its total assets under management to about $3 billion. This is the firm’s largest funding haul ever, exceeding the $900 million it raised two years ago.\\nAt a time when many venture firms have been forced to cut back their fund sizes, Farmer says raising such a large fund means that SignalFire is “well out of the proof-of-concept phase and into the established manager phase.”\\nSrtictlyVC London\\nStrictlyVC is coming to London!

We're bringing together the brightest minds in venture for an evening of candid conversations, top-tier networking, and delicious bites. Join us and be part of the movement shaping the future of innovation.\\nLondon | May 13\\nREGISTER NOW\\nThe firm’s new LPs include giant pension plans, insurable banks, and an Asian sovereign, Farmer said. Indeed, CalPERS, the largest pension fund in the U.S., has reportedly committed $100 million to SignalFire for the first time.\\nAccording to Farmer, a significant reason some of the world’s biggest institutional investors were excited to back in his firm was its focus on seed and pre-seed startups.\\nGiven their size and inherent bureaucracy, giant LPs prefer to write large checks to established firms that are expected to persist. “Most seed funds are small. They have a few great funds, and then they’re done,” he said. “It’s very hard for big institutions to back firms like that.”\\nFarmer claims that with SignalFire, huge investors can get the best of both worlds: exposure to very young startups at the scale and longevity they need.\\nAlthough the firm’s first point of entry into startups is at the pre-seed and seed stages, its model is to use its giant fund to keep investing in companies as they grow. Of course, this strategy isn’t too different from most multi-stage firms, except that most of those investors tend to be more focused on initially backing companies at Series A.\\n“We use our scale to outgun everyone at the seed,” Farmer said, noting that SignalFire has invested $100 million into some companies. That kind of capital is not readily available to most seed-focused firms.\\nFarmer said the firm’s model has helped it identify trends before its competitors despite having few significant exits. He points to early investments in startups such as \\xa0Grammarly, which was last valued at $13 billion; Grow Therapy, which last year raised an $88 million Series C from Sequoia; and EvenUp, an AI software for personal injury lawyers that’s worth over $1 billion.\\nFor this new set of funds, the firm plans to continue investing in sector-specific AI startups, including\\xa0healthcare and pharma, consumer, infrastructure and developer tools, and cybersecurity.\\nDespite its AI focus, SignalFire is deliberately avoiding companies building the foundation layer for AI models.\\n“I think that many venture dollars going into model builders is at a massive risk. They’re getting leapfrogged every couple of weeks by another model. You don’t know whether it’s defensible,” he said.\\nOn the contrary, SignalFire tries to invest in companies whose businesses model or tech can’t be easily replicated.\\xa0“EvenUp doesn’t have a competitor. I like deep, deep, deep defensibility,” Farmer said.\\nTopics\\nEvenUp, Fundraising, grammarly, limited partners, pre-seed, seed stage, signalfire, Venture\\nMarina Temkin\\nReporter, Venture\\nMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

And they might be an important frontier for higher education in 2025, according to Ardis Kadiu, founder of ed-tech company Element451.\\nSpeaking to attendees at the ASU+GSV Summit AI Show on April 6, Kadiu said students increasingly expect intelligent, personalized experiences from their institutions that traditional staffing simply can’t provide. Kadiu cited author and journalist Jeff Selingo in pointing out that students can wait two to six weeks for appointments with mental health services and up to two and a half hours for financial aid assistance, but they want those experiences to be efficient and personal.\\n“This avalanche is coming in, and more support is needed,” Kadiu said. “AI can really bridge that gap.”\\nIn 2012, he said, AI was about perceiving the world around us, through functions such as speech recognition and image identification, with common applications in translation and medical imaging. The next big jump was in late 2022 with generative AI, which creates content rather than just analyzing it. In 2025, Kadiu said, agentic AI takes action rather than only responding to real-time prompts to generate content.\\nThat means there are new opportunities to use AI not just as a tool, but as a teammate, and Kadiu predicted that early adopters will have a competitive advantage. Through live demonstrations, he showed his audience a variety of uses for AI agents in higher education, from admissions counseling to campaign strategizing.\\nKadiu's company, Element451, is one of many offering AI agent services for higher education. On the surface, some of these services may resemble generative AI systems that users are more familiar with, but behind the scenes, they involve a system of AI agents working together, similar to how human staff would.\\nKadiu said AI agents are specialized with a skill type, a goal, a communication style and a set of actions it can take, like initiating an email or phone call. While the agent can take action on its own, it also has a set of “approvers” linked to it who OK each action before it takes place.\\nFor example, a recruiting agent might have the overall goal of getting a student to apply to a university. It will use existing university data systems to determine the best time for outreach, then create an email, SMS message, phone call or WhatsApp message. If that action is approved, the agent will store a transcript of the outreach plus any questions it fields in the student’s file, which the agent will use to inform human staff as well as its next course of action.\\n“We can just give the goal and provide all the tools and let the AI reason about it, and because it's built on all of the context and the data and all the prior conversations, it's probably the best way to kind of bring all those pieces together and not miss anything, right?” Kadiu said. “Imagine that you have to go from person to person, or that you have to see 500 students. It’s impossible to keep all their context in your head.”\\nIn the live demonstration, when Element451’s Vice President of Product Eric Range told an agent named Carolyn that he was ready to apply to the fictional Element University’s nursing program, Carolyn sent him a link to the application in real time.\\nAnother use case might be for financial aid help, especially with recent Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) hiccups. Kadiu said the Element451 financial aid agent is trained on studentaid.gov resources, and institutions can input their own resources as well. Specializing the agents means that one chatbot doesn’t need to know everything about the university, it just needs to know what the other agents do.\\n“They can hand things off to each other, just like a real human team would on the support channel,” Kadiu said.\\nFor example, when Range used a chatbot to ask about scholarships, a financial aid agent named Finley answered his questions. When he moved on to questions about athletic scholarships and asked how to try out for the soccer team, Finley passed him to a different agent specializing in athletics named Coach Carter.\\nOutside of community-facing communications, the reasoning abilities of AI agents can make them helpful for things like application management. Kadiu showed off an agent that evaluated applications based on a given criteria and gave a preliminary score.\\n“It’s making references to the documents: ‘Shows a GPA of 3.7, which places them above the 3.5 threshold. However, none of the provided documents include evidence of at least three AP honors courses,’ and that was part of the criteria,” Kadiu said.\\nThe agent also assessed the application for fraud.\\nIn the future, Kadiu said, AI agents could be added to course management systems to provide personalized interventions for students based on criteria like not attending class or missing assignments. But there are limits to what he will ask AI agents to do.\\n“We made a clear delineation in the sand, so to speak, around, ‘Hey, we don’t want to mess around with the class pedagogy right now,’” he said.\\nFacebook\\nLinkedIn\\nTwitter\\nPrint\\nEmail\\nTags:\\nArtificial Intelligence Higher EducationEducationASU+GSV\\nAbby Sourwine\\nAbby Sourwine is a staff writer for the Center for Digital Education.

With agentic AI, the \"standards went up fast,\" Jonathan Userovici, general partner at VC firm Headline, told Business Insider.\\n\"Investors don\\'t just want to be impressed — they want to be educated, convinced, and excited. Your deck has to do all three,\" he said.\\nBI examined the pitch decks used by founders of five agentic AI startups to gauge what makes a successful presentation.\\nHere are three things the decks had in common — and what investors think would make a standout slideshow.\\nHighlight a community and network of supporters and users\\nBreakout\\nHaving a stamp of approval from advisors from top companies gives investors another avenue to conduct their due diligence and suggests the product is trusted and used by industry heavyweights.\\nBreakout, a startup that has launched AI sales agents, clearly outlines some key figures backing its mission in its deck. With $3.25 million in fresh funding under its belt, the company is looking to manage software companies\\' inbound sales.\\nOptimHire\\nSimilarly, OptimHire, a startup replacing recruiters with AI agents, showcased the agencies it has matched its product with — highlighting a strong product-market fit. It raised $5 million in March using this pitch deck.\\nClearly outline a specific solution to an existing market problem\\nDeckmatch\\nDeckmatch, a startup that allows private market investors to automate their work, vividly presents a key issue in the market — the way unstructured data makes workflow less efficient when deal sourcing. It goes on to outline solutions to the issue in a deck that helped it bag $3.1 million in seed funding in November 2024.\\nDeckmatch\\nThis slide exemplifies three ways in which the startup would combat the issue of unstructured data and how its platform could be integrated into the likes of email and WhatsApp.\\nOptimHire\\nSimilarly, OptimHire also pointed to tangible ways in which its platform has served its users — by cutting the number of hours needed to screen profiles and schedule interviews.\\nShow retention and budget replacement\\nAuxia\\nRevenue and pricing metrics are a key staple in any good pitch deck — but startups should clarify the long-term value-add their platform presents.\\nUserovici says retention is the new annual recurring revenue, or ARR.\\n\"Many AI apps, especially the \\'prosumer\\' ones, spike immediately as users rush to try them,\" said Userovici, referring to individuals who consume and produce. \"The world is full of flashy demos; retention is your proof of reality. Great decks lean into that.\"\\nAuxia, a startup that\\'s developed an AI agent for marketing and sales, raised a combined funding round totaling $23.5 million in March.\\nIts deck highlighted its consistent growth trajectory over nine months, showcasing how the product is retained beyond an initial use case.\\nGenie AI\\nGenie AI, a legal tech startup that\\'s built an AI agent for law firms, raised nearly $18 million in a round led by Google Ventures in October 2024.\\nIts pitch deck not only demonstrates strong customer retention but also explains how its platform offers strategic value to companies — something investors are keen to see in decks.\\nGenie AI\\n\"We\\'re seeing a shift in pricing as well. Winning AI founders price like they\\'re replacing a budget — not just selling a tool. Show us the math behind it,\" Userovici told BI.\\n\"Anchor it to value, savings, or new revenue. Highlight what you replace, not just what you add,\" he added. \"Show us which outsourced services, tools, or vendors you\\'re eliminating. In a way, traditional SaaS was sold to the CIO.

Delangue highlighted the importance of building agents “just for fun” as a low-friction path to innovation. Isenberg underscored the rise of solo founders with agent teams, predicting, \"The next billion-dollar startup will be one person with a fleet of AI agents.”\\nAI Agent Infrastructure\\nModerated by Burhan Sebin, this panel explored how agentic workflows are built, scaled, and trusted. Panelists Garrett Rowe (NeuralSeek), Ryan Doan (Outrival AI), and Lou Mata (Mainframe) shared insights into orchestration, memory, user trust, and the real-time challenges of deploying AI agents in complex environments.\\nEnterprise Adoption & Investment\\nThis enterprise-focused session brought together Ed Sim, Partner at Boldstart Ventures, and Hernan Londono, Ph.D., Chief Innovation Strategist at Lenovo, moderated by Ayal Stern of The LAB Miami.\\nEd Sim emphasized the need for strong founder-market fit in early-stage AI startups, while Hernan discussed how global enterprises are navigating the AI adoption curve.\\nReal-World Use Cases\\nThe final panel, moderated by Iman Oubou, Co-Founder of Vocable AI, featured Trevor Lee (Myko AI) and Peter Yared (InCountry). From content creation to field sales and compliance-heavy industries, panelists shared their experience with real-world implementations.\\nFinal thoughts were delivered by Burhan Sebin, who reflected on the energy and momentum sparked by the gathering:\\n“This wasn’t just an event, it was a movement,” said Sebin. “We’re proud to have brought this community together to shape the next generation of AI right here in Miami. And we will expand to other cities across the U.S. and beyond.”\\nThe Miami AI Agent Summit’s success was made possible by the tireless efforts of the Miami AI Hub volunteer team, and the generous support of CrewAI, Atlas Space, Late Checkout, EZ Newswire, 4A Labs, and The LAB Miami.\\nAbout Miami AI Hub\\nMiami AI Hub fosters innovation and collaboration in artificial intelligence within the city’s vibrant tech ecosystem.

Are They Ready to Use It?\\nBy Olina Banerji — April 08, 2025 7 min read\\nVladgrin/iStock/Getty\\nShare article\\nRemove Save to favorites Save to favorites\\nPrint\\nEmail Facebook LinkedIn Twitter Copy URL\\nThe number of districts that trained teachers on generative artificial intelligence more than doubled from 2023 to 2024, according to a new analysis by the research and policy firm RAND Corp.\\nIn the fall of 2024, 48 percent of districts reported they had trained teachers on AI use—up from 23 percent in the fall of 2023. RAND surveyed about 300 districts in 2024 and about 200 in 2023 and weighted their responses to make them representative of all public school districts.\\nIf districts follow their plans for the current school year, nearly three-quarters will have provided AI training to educators by the fall of 2025.\\nSee Also\\nSchool & District Management The Popularity of 4-Day School Weeks, in Charts As more schools adopt the shorter week, some opinions on the modified schedule might be surprising.\\nThis professional development has been slow to gain ground in schools. While generative AI became mainstream in late 2022 with the launch of ChatGPT, 7 in 10 teachers had not received any training on how to use AI in the classroom by spring 2024, according to a nationally representative survey from the EdWeek Research Center. By fall 2024, though, 43 percent of teachers said they had received at least one training session on AI, the EdWeek Research Center found.\\nBoth teachers and principals are increasingly using AI in their day-to-day work. While principals use AI tools for administrative tasks like making schedules, writing newsletters, or crunching large datasets, teachers are more likely to use AI to generate lesson plans, customize lessons for students who might learn at different speeds and levels, or even use it creatively—to emulate a historical or fictional character to teach a particular lesson, for instance.\\nEven so, most districts took a gradual approach to introducing their teachers to AI.\\nIn addition to fielding the surveys, RAND conducted in-depth interviews with 14 district leaders on how they crafted their AI trainings in 2024. Instead of jumping straight into AI tools and their use, district leaders focused first on tackling teachers’ concerns about the technology.\\nOf the 14 leaders interviewed, all but one said they encountered “negative views of AI and reported that some teachers view it as a threat to traditional teaching methods or a tool for student cheating,” according to the report.\\nDistrict leaders said they provided training on the fundamental workings of AI—and its limitations—to lower teachers’ anxiety, and “shift away from an antagonistic, cheating-centered mentality” about AI.\\nAmong the 14 districts, trainings varied in length and content—from daylong trainings to “bite-sized” content delivered through regular emails and newsletters. All but one district made such training voluntary.\\n“I am not trying to push AI with my people, but I am trying to give them the tools if they’re interested. I know that as [AI adoption] starts happening, it will grow organically and very quickly,” one district leader told RAND researchers.\\nDistrict leaders tend to craft their own training\\nThe district leaders interviewed by RAND preferred crafting their own trainings, rather than relying on outside experts, said Melissa Diliberti, an associate policy researcher at RAND and a lead author on the report, in an email.\\n“This do-it-yourself approach, though potentially employed to meet specific district needs, also reflects a scarcity of external experts who are capable of providing appropriate training,” Diliberti said.\\nOf the 14 district leaders interviewed, 11 took a DIY approach to crafting their own AI training. They pieced together different kinds of resources put out by tech companies like Google, as well as education organizations like Digital Promise and the International Society for Technology in Education.\\nHalf of the interviewees said they struggled to find training experts who were knowledgeable about using AI in an educational context.\\nA time and resource crunch also pushed district leaders to pull together their own training, in the absence of ready-to-use resources, the report stated. Professional development in AI jostles for space among several other competing PD priorities, which can affect the length and depth of such training, the district leaders said.\\nDistrict leaders also used their own “negative” experiences with AI trainings—where they were left overwhelmed—to streamline the training they offered so it addressed teachers’ immediate needs.\\nA suburban West Coast district, for instance, first introduced “play” sessions to alleviate teachers’ anxiety about AI, before gradually moving onto more instruction-based learning.\\nThe “play” approach, in this district and others, consisted of teachers experimenting with an AI chatbot or platform and getting the hang of what AI can do. There were more focused sessions, too, in which district leaders introduced tools like MagicSchool or ChatGPT to show teachers how to use them to plan lessons or generate differentiated content for students.\\nChris Chism, the superintendent of the Pearl school district in Mississippi who was not associated with the RAND report, also created his own AI training module for teachers. His training, too, emphasizes both experimenting with the technology, and showcasing more streamlined, direct uses for the classroom.\\nIn an interview with Education Week last July, Chism said he had created mini chatbots that deliver essential information to teachers about specific topics. One chatbot, for instance, can generate lesson plans aligned with the state’s standards.\\nWhile district leaders’ trainings may be more in tune with a teacher’s needs, Diliberti said the quality and what’s covered in these trainings could vary between districts.\\nThere’s an equity gap in AI training\\nDespite the overall surge in AI training, the RAND report shows that such training is unevenly distributed—compared to nearly 67 percent of low-poverty districts that have introduced AI training for teachers, only 39 percent of high-poverty districts were able to do the same.\\nRAND used districts’ plans to project what the training gap might look like in the fall of 2025. While nearly all low-poverty district would have trained teachers on AI use, only 6 in 10 high-poverty districts would have done so, if districts stick to their plans.\\nSchools in low-poverty districts are more likely to have the time and resources to experiment with AI tools and figure out how to use them well for instructional practice. It’s not a luxury that schools in high-poverty districts may have, said Diliberti.\\nThis gap in training, or guidance, on how to use AI persists among the principal group, too, according to a previous RAND report published in February. Thirteen percent of principals in the highest-poverty schools said they got guidance, versus about a quarter of principals in lower-poverty schools.\\n“Teachers in higher-poverty schools are less likely to use AI, [as are] principals in the highest-poverty schools. So that probably drives whether the school system or the school itself is like, ‘Oh, we really need to provide guidance,’” Julia Kaufman, a senior policy researcher at RAND and lead author of the February report, told Education Week at the time.\\nThe faster takeup of AI by teachers in low-poverty districts means that teachers and students in high-poverty ones won’t have the same opportunity to learn from AI tools, the report says.\\nThere are still no clear links between greater reliance on AI tools and higher-quality teaching or learning, Diliberti said.\\n“But to the degree that we anticipate this might be true, greater uptake of AI in historically advantaged school settings does raise concerns that the rollout of AI into schools could exacerbate longstanding fault lines of educational inequality,” Diliberti added.\\nThe report calls for more targeted funding by federal and state education agencies to high-poverty districts to procure model professional development in AI and cultivate connections to networks of experts.\\nThe report also suggested that districts with more experience in training teachers on AI should share their expertise with other districts through state and regional education networks.\\nThe surge in training notwithstanding, Diliberti said it’s still too early to figure how exactly AI might fit into a district’s PD schedule for the year.\\n“Evidence from our district leaders suggest that their trainings are in the very early stages. [They are] more focused on just getting teachers comfortable with AI tools,” Diliberti said. “Regular teacher training on whether and how to best incorporate specific AI tools into instructional practice may still be some time away.”\\nOlina Banerji\\nFollow Unfollow\\nStaff Writer,\\xa0 Education Week\\nOlina Banerji is a reporter for Education Week who covers school leadership.\\ntwitter\\nemail\\nlinkedin\\nMost Popular Stories\\nOpen image caption\\nClose image caption\\nErin Huff, a 24-year-old kindergarten teacher at Waverly Elementary in Illinois, pictured here on Dec. 18, 2019, says low pay, high stress, and heavy workloads often discourage young people from entering teacher preparation programs.

The authors assess the detection of autism-related learning difficulties in children by evaluating deep learning models that use transfer learning methods along with fine-tuning methods. Using autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosed child RGB images data, researchers evaluated six prevalent deep learning structures: DenseNet201, ResNet152, VGG16, VGG19, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNet-B0. ResNet152 reached the highest accuracy rate of 89% when functioning independently. This paper develops a hybrid deep-learning model by integrating ResNet152 with Vision Transformers (ViT) to achieve better classification performance. The ViT-ResNet152 model’s convolutional and transformer processing elements worked together to improve the accuracy of the diagnosis to 91.33% and make it better at finding different cases of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).The research outcomes demonstrate that AI tools show promise for delivering highly precise and standardized methods to detect ASD at an early stage. Future research needs to include multiple data types as well as extend dataset variability while optimizing hybrid architecture systems to elevate diagnostic forecasting. The incorporation of artificial intelligence in ASD evaluation services holds promise to transform early therapy approaches, which leads to better results for autistic children all around the globe.\\nIntroduction\\nASD is a developmental disorder with the primary defining features being difficulty in social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication, and limited interests and repetitive behaviors. This disorder occurs in about every 54 children around the globe, and thus early detection and early intervention can help minimize the effects1,2. Standard diagnostic methods that are partly used for diagnosing autism entail behavioral methods that take a considerable amount of time and are moralistic in that they are often open to bias. There is therefore increasing interest in using deep learning from AI to flag early learning difficulties linked to autism more objectively and at a larger scale3. The detection of ASD through facial expression analysis represents a promising method because it offers non-obtrusive testing along with easy implementation capabilities and potential for identifying ASD early. Biomedical assessment methods, including behavioral assessments and speech analysis, involve expensive expert evaluation together with subjective analysis, while facial analysis through deep learning delivers both objective measurements and scalable solutions. Behavioral tracking techniques show merit in ASD diagnosis but need prolonged observation times, which makes them difficult to access and time-consuming. Language barriers, together with the individual variations in speech development among children with ASD, limit the effectiveness of speech analysis. The analysis of facial elements demonstrates uniformity among all demographics and permits exact measurement through automated AI processing. Deep learning models have proven effective at detecting facial characteristics in ASD children because studies confirm these patients show unique facial patterns with abnormal eye movements and variations in facial shape along with muscle control. Through facial image analysis, this research develops a method to detect autism spectrum disorder early using reliable technology that supports current diagnostic practices without requiring human opinions.\\nThe progress made in the field of AI and its subspecialty of machine learning has been instrumental in practicing improvements in areas such as neurodevelopmental disorders that include autism spectrum disorder. It found that deep learning, as a branch of machine learning, has significant applications of analyzing intricate data structures such as images and behavioral data for diagnosis and classification of various health conditions4. Of particular importance, CNNs have been applied in the study of medical images with remarkable accuracy in tasks such as the detection of tumors and brain imaging analysis5,6. Such successes have created enthusiasm in the use of deep learning approaches in the diagnosis of ASD with the hopes of identifying pointers of learning impairments related to autism at a very tender age7.\\nThere are numerous discussions addressing the implementation of deep learning in the situation of ASD. For instance, Heinsfeld et al.7 employed a deep learning model of the identification of ASD using rs-fMRI data with a success rate of 70%. In the same vein, Duda et al.8 trained the machine learning algorithms to extract the ASD-related behaviors from electronic health records, mapping the applicability of the AI for early diagnosis. Strong evidence from such studies points towards how AI can help to process and analyze intricate data that may be difficult for experts in the ASD field to process and analyze, hence leading to more accurate diagnosis9,10.\\nDeep learning research focused on ASD detection techniques demonstrates strong findings, yet practical implementation remains challenging because of identified technical boundaries. CNN-based models show strong results for medical image diagnosis, including ASD screening, yet they face difficulties in processing extended dependencies within facial information. The ability to learn global representations is a transformer-based model’s strength, while it fails to capture CNN-like spatial feature extraction abilities. Most previous research studies examined single-model architecture that did not allow complete exploitation of cross-model advantages. The small number of relatively imbalanced ASD detection datasets poses problems for deep learning models to reach reliable generalization.\\nThis paper evaluates the identification of autism-related learning difficulties in children using transfer learning and fine-tuning on six deep learning models, which include DenseNet201, ResNet152, VGG16, EfficientNet-B0, MobileNetV2, and VGG19. The evaluation utilized selected deep-learning models because they demonstrated strong results in image classification duties and showed potential when analyzing ASD-related behavioral data and image information. The dense connections in DenseNet201 advance both information exchange and gradient update, and EfficientNet-B0 delivers optimized precision and computational performance. Analyzing these models concerning ASD diagnosis can identify the most suitable artificial intelligence tools for clinical use. Previous research examined individual neural network models or conducted minimal architectural identity evaluations but failed to conduct thorough evaluations regarding multiple deep learning structures for ASD diagnosis.\\nThe researchers chose deep learning models for this study because they showed proven success in image classification while demonstrating potential for ASD diagnostic work. CNNs such as VGG16 and VGG19 with DenseNet201, along with EfficientNet-B0 as well as MobileNetV2, find extensive medical imaging usage by handling hierarchical spatial feature extraction. DenseNet201 solves both feature gradient problems and computational efficiency challenges, but EfficientNet-B0 finds the optimum accuracy-efficiency trade-off. MobileNetV2 functions best with lightweight applications, thus making it appropriate for real-time ASD screening. Vision Transformer architecture enables self-attention operations to detect subtle features linked to ASD because it evaluates lengthy image relationships effectively. The deep residual connections in ResNet152 improve the flow of gradients to stop vanishing gradients from impacting deep networks. The proposed model unites the ViT architecture with ResNet152 to exploit their complementary strengths, which allows global feature extraction from ViT and hierarchical spatial representation from ResNet152 for better classification outcomes and diagnostic generalization. The integrated approach solves current ASD detection model challenges since these models depend solely on CNNs or transformers without utilizing their separate strengths completely.\\nThe application of AI diagnosis in ASD stands at a critical juncture because of substantial hurdles when it comes to identifying early signs through facial expressions. Current diagnosis approaches depend on behavioral observations from humans that require extended periods and cost a lot of money while demonstrating human judgment issues. Deep learning successfully analyzes medical images, yet its use for detecting autism spectrum disorder through facial recognition faces several challenges because ASD facial indicators are difficult to detect and available data remains limited and imbalanced. The current research landscape features primarily CNN-based structures or transformer-based models yet fails to combine spatial characteristics extraction with contextual information learning capabilities. The proposed hybrid ResNet152-ViT model emerges as a solution to overcome the challenges presented by diagnosing autism spectrum disorder from facial images because it improves both classification performance and model stability while maximizing generalization potential.\\nThis paper develops a hybrid deep learning framework that merges Vision Transformer (ViT) with the ResNet152 architecture to boost classification precision and model generalizability. The proposed combination of ViT transformer self-attention mechanisms with ResNet152 hierarchical features achieves higher performance in autism learning difficulty detection between children’s groups. The combined deep learning system achieves improved diagnostic precision as well as generalizing its performance on a wide range of ASD cases. The hybrid ResNet152 with Vision Transformer (ViT) system aims to produce better ASD diagnosis results by using the advantages of each architecture from facial image analysis. ResNet152 demonstrates outstanding performance in extracting multi-level spatial features to detect subtle facial cues that indicate ASD manifestations in images. When deployed in certain situations, CNNs demonstrate restrictions in their ability to detect both long-range dependencies and global contextual information. The self-attention processes of ViT identify relationships between elements across complete images because they effectively discover structural patterns that single CNN networks cannot detect. Combining ResNet152 features with ViT features leads to an improved feature representation, which both prevents model overfitting and adds to system accuracy levels. A synergistic approach analyzes both facial image texture details and broader contextual relationships, which results in a resilient ASD classification model.\\nThe main contribution of this research seeks to develop healthcare AI through comprehensive deep learning model effectiveness evaluation, including the investigation of recommended hybrid architecture for identifying ASD-related learning difficulties at early stages. This research produces results to help scientists create more efficient diagnostic methods that allow timely detection of ASD while maintaining patient safety and comfort to enable better early intervention and enhance ASD patient quality of life.\\nThe paper is structured in the following manner. A review of the literature and information pertinent to the investigation are found in Section “Related work”. The materials and methods of deep neural network details are provided in Section “Materials and methods”. The experimental results are covered in Section “Experimental results”.

Heinsfeld et al. (2018) in7 showed that using deep learning algorithms, a classification accuracy of 70% is possible with the help of resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data for differentiating between ASD and individuals with ASD. Many approaches of using the application of AI in neurodevelopmental disorder diagnosis proved that deep learning can efficiently process large data of images data. Besides images, machine learning has also been used more and more often with behavioral data traceable with ASD. In a similar vein, Duda et al. (2016) in8 mined EHR for behaviors that can be used in identifying patients with ASD through machine learning. This approach thus highlighted how AI could improve early diagnostic capability through the analysis of extensive behavioral data that can be cumbersome for a clinician to perform manually. Based on such preparation, Voulodimos et al. (2018) in11 compared different sorts of CNNs for medical image analysis. Moreover, they projected DenseNet, ResNet, and VGG having high accord in tasks that include medical imaging. They were instrumental in bringing strong methodology in using such architectures for diagnosing ASD, particularly when working with image data. Newer and sustainable developments in deep learning are new models like EfficientNet-B0 that are accurate and efficient at the same time. In12, Tan and Le introduced EfficientNet-B0, which makes better use not just of depth and width at the same time–previous architectures have scaled width and depth inefficiently. This is quite innovative and has broad implications for medical diagnostics, at least where identification of learning challenges linked to ASD is concerned.\\nIn the same way, Howard et al. (2019) in13 came up with MobileNetV2, a model designed to improve its efficiency in the mobile and edge stations. MobileNetV2 is a lightweight deep learning framework that can be used in real-time diagnostic applications and therefore has the potential of facilitating the early diagnosis of ASD. As with other tasks of medical image analysis, the model can be useful for ASD diagnosis too. Hence, there’s no doubt that undertaking a diagnosis for ASD at the right time and with precision is vital. As mentioned by Wallace et al. (2020) in14, early identification and early intervention positively impact the quality of the lives of children with ASD. In their study of the intervention implemented during the early developmental stage, they underscored the importance of valid diagnostic instruments that can diagnose ASD at an early age, hence appropriate treatment. Chen et al. (2017) in15 employed deep learning systems in identifying measures of connectivity in the brain of people with ASD. They used a CNN model to analyze the fMRI-derived functional connectivity matrices with a high level of accuracy for classifying individuals with ASD from TD. This work supports the notion of appreciating the depth of learning in trying to demystify the neural circuitry of ASD. Lombardo et al. (2019) in16 did not attempt to derive a new model for the diagnostic criterion but used genetics and images to enhance the diagnostic validity of the ASD diagnosis. They employed a multimodal deep learning framework that incorporates genetic information of the patient along with brain image information, and the authors showed that the utilization of such methodology could improve the diagnostic accuracy. This work serves as an example of how more than one kind of data can be used in the ASD diagnostic process. However, there are certain limitations associated with the incorporation of AI in the diagnosis of ASD. The application of AI in healthcare regarding the use of robots in neurodevelopmental disorders, such as ASD, was described by Abdelnour et al.17 with a focus on the ethically informed aspect of AI use. They advocate for transparency in the training of the AI models, interpretability, and fairness to ensure that the tools that are clinical are used appropriately.\\nLi et al.18 also looked at the nature of AI in managing individual therapy for persons with ASD. Their research was applied to the aspect of utilizing machine learning algorithms with the aim of estimating the part-specific reaction to several intercessions in order to design and implement specific treatment plans. Such an approach might help improve the treatment outcomes and provide a better matching of the patient needs in cases of ASD. The use of deep learning in diagnosing and differentiating other ailments also enhances its usage in ASD. Litjens et al.19 summarized deep learning applied in radiology, where the authors showed deep learning to be highly accurate for tasks such as nodule detection and organ segmentation. Such successes imply that the same strategies can be borrowed in the handling of image data in the diagnosis of ASD. Another related work by Zhao et al.20 used eye-tracking data and analyzes them using a deep learning approach to extract features that are linked to the disorder. By using this machine learning model to decode looking at time and direction for each stimulus, they were able to classify ASD and TD individuals and thus proved that AI has the capability to analyze non-conventional forms of data for diagnosing ASD. Moreover, in diagnosing ASD, the use of images and behavioral data reports, as well as an analysis of speech, has also been done. Deep learning was employed by Palkovics et al.21 in identifying speech patterns in children with ASD and found a very high correct classification rate between the children with ASD and those who are typically developing. Based on this research, deep learning can be considered more generally across different areas linked to the diagnosis of ASD. This has been supported by the work of Shen et al.22, whereby they used a CNN model to detect Alzheimer’s disease from MRI scans. Their studies evidenced the specificity of the model to identify various phases of Alzheimer’s, and a similar approach could be used in identifying the signs of ASD at the early beginning. Eslami et al.23 have acknowledged the enhancement of AI with conventional diagnosis approaches. They suggested an integration of deep learning with the work of experts to improve the accuracy of ASD diagnosis. This approach stresses the synergy between AI and professionals work to get the best results in clinical practice.\\nHayder and Amir24 investigated the potential effectiveness of combining Vision Transformers with Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks for early autism spectrum disorder diagnosis through facial image analysis. Static facial characteristics serve as biomarkers that help the proposed model detect delicate ASD-related signals more effectively. The evaluated data demonstrates deep learning has great potential for ASD screening because it correctly identifies autistic patients alongside typically developing children.\\nThe authors of Karthik et al.25 underline that discovering autism spectrum disorder (ASD) during early phases is necessary for effective intervention application. The research examines ASD recognition in facial pictures using three model combinations that incorporate Vision Transformer (ViT) with PCA-SVM, ViT with CatBoost, and SHAP along with VGG16 with XGBoost. The developed models enhance picture processing through error reduction and better detection of subtle facial features linked to ASD. The experimental findings show deep learning methods produce superior outcomes compared to conventional models, which strengthens their importance in early ASD diagnosis. Mujeeb and Subashini26 state that neurological autism spectrum disorder disrupts human social interactions and cognitive processing in individuals. VGG16, VGG19, and EfficientNetB0 deep learning models identified autistic faces from non-autistic faces for research that resulted in accuracies of 84.66%, 80.05%, and 87.9% successively. The models received training from 3,014 facial images available on Kaggle, which showed both autistic and non-autistic childhood emotions. Pranavi and Andrew27 emphasize that spotting autism spectrum disorder (ASD) early leads to enhanced quality of life for children with ASD together with their families. The research team conducted ASD biomarker detection through facial image analysis using MobileNet along with three other pre-trained CNN models (Xception, EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetB1) and a DNN classifier structure. The tests determined Xception to be the most effective model, which detected ASD with 96.63% AUC and 88.46% sensitivity.\\nMaterials and methods\\nThis section provides an analysis of the use of deep learning algorithms used in this work to diagnose learning difficulties associated with autism in children. We utilized six state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures: DenseNet201, ResNet152, VGG16, EfficientNet-B0, MobileNetV2, VGG19, and the hybrid proposed model. All these models were trained and tested on a dataset involving images and behavior data to gauge their ability to identify and distinguish students having ASD-related learning difficulties.\\nDenseNet201\\nDenseNet201 is a complex CNN where every layer receives inputs from the previous layer as well as from all the previous layers existing in the network. This means there are many more shared parameters through the network, meaning issues such as the vanishing gradient problem are minimized. The DenseNet201 model is made up of several dense blocks, where each block is made of several convolution layers, as shown in Fig.\\xa01. These blocks relate to transition layers that are the same as down sampling sections that create pool layers to let the network decrease the spatial size of the feature maps while preserving important data. One of the peculiarities of DenseNet201 is that the growth rate is another parameter that determines the number of new feature maps introduced by each layer. This growth rate assumes significant importance in preventing the network capacity and the computational capability from getting to extremes. When there is a complex pattern in the data and/or there is not much data that can be used for training, then DenseNet201 is very useful because deep supervision is provided and fine-grained feature connections are ensured through several layers28,29,30.\\nFig. 1\\nDenseNet-201 architecture.\\nFull size image\\nResNet152\\nResNet152 is a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that falls into the family of Residual Networks (ResNet) architectures that revolutionized deep learning by introducing residual learning. One of the major ideas of ResNet is so-called shortcut connections, or skips, that let the model omit one or several layers as shown in Fig.\\xa02. These connections enable the network to learn identity mappings and hence provide a solution to the degradation issue, which results from adding more layers to a deep neural network’s training by enhancing the training error31. ResNet152 has more layers compared to other counterparts in ResNet, with an outstanding 152 layers for identification of sophisticated features in large databases. The architecture utilizes convolutional layers that are immediately followed by batch normalization, ReLU activation, and the identity blocks, which incorporate the skip connections that ensure that the gradient flow is not compromised during the backpropagation. This design also makes it possible to train very deep networks and helps to improve the ability of the generalization across various problems32,33.\\nFig. 2\\nBasic ResNet architecture.\\nFull size image\\nVGG16\\nVGG16 is a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) known for its simplicity and effectiveness, particularly in image classification tasks. The architecture comprises 16 layers, including 13 convolutional layers followed by three fully connected layers, as shown in Fig.\\xa03. Each convolutional layer employs small 3\\u2009×\\u20093 receptive fields, which enables the model to capture fine details and intricate patterns in input images. This use of small filters allows VGG16 to build a deep hierarchy of features, progressively capturing more complex patterns as the data passes through the layers. Following the convolutional layers, max-pooling layers are introduced to reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps while retaining the most salient features. Despite its relatively straightforward architecture, VGG16 achieves high performance by stacking multiple layers and relying on small filters, which makes it effective for various computer vision tasks34,35.\\nFig. 3\\nVGG-16 architecture.\\nFull size image\\nVGG19\\nVGG19 is yet another architecture of CNN, which is like VGG16, except it is deeper as it possesses 3 more convolution layers than VGG16 to make a total of 19 layers, as shown in Fig.\\xa04. These additional layers provide an increase in the expressive ability and provide the model with the capacity to discern additional levels of information and characteristics in the images, which might help to increase the results of classification of images. As seen in VGG16, the overall network structure of VGG19 still remains the same along with the parameter of using small 3\\u2009×\\u20093 convolutions so that the model can learn the details of the input images. Like what was observed in VGG16, the convolutional layers of the VGG19 network are succeeded by the max-pooling layers, whose role is to decrease the size of the feature map while at the same time preserving the most crucial features. These reductions in the spatial dimension are also useful to manage the computational complexity of the network. At the end of the network, there are fully connected layers that are used to execute classification on the learned features36,37.\\nFig. 4\\nVGG-19 architecture.\\nFull size image\\nEfficientNet-B0\\nEfficientNet-B0 is a widely employed deep learning model that optimizes for both accuracy and resources, allowing it to be one of the most powerful architectures for the image classification task, as shown in Fig.\\xa05. Depth-wise, width-wise, and resolution-wise, the scaling of the network’s dimensions is also formulated uniformly by a powerful and simple formula that the model offers. This makes it possible to scale up the model’s capacity to other, larger versions, which, in effect, produce a hierarchy of models, each more complex and accurate than the last. EfficientNet-B0 is the fundamental model from which all others in the EfficientNet series are derived. The architecture follows mobile inverted bottleneck convolution (MBConv) layers that are light on parameters and have a great capability in feature extraction. Also, it incorporates the depth-wise separable convolutions, which help to cut the computational burden that is normally caused by the standard convolutional layers into the depth-wise and point-wise CV or convolutional layers. Such deliberations allow EfficientNet-B0 to achieve accuracy on par with other state-of-the-art designs at much lower parameter and FLOPs costs relative to the CNN counterparts12,38.\\nFig. 5\\nEfficientNet-B0 architecture.\\nFull size image\\nMobileNetV2\\nMobileNetV2 is a convolutional neural network specially designed for optimizing the network and computational resources for mobile and IoT devices and thus is very suitable for scalable autism diagnosis systems. The architecture is based on depth-wise separable convolutions that drastically decrease computational requirements as standard convolution is divided into two layers: one for feature extraction and another for feature merging shown in Fig.\\xa06. This significantly reduces the quantity of parameters and Floating-Point Operations (FLOPs); hence, the model is non-gargantuan and proficient. Another significant change incorporated in MobileNetV2 is that of inverted residuals with linear bottlenecks. In this structure, the shortcut connections that are linking the layers can exclude full-dimensional feature maps, but the important parts of the previous layers are able to be preserved and at the same time keep the model very compact. Not only does this design optimize computation, but also the significant attributes that must be preserved across layers are maintained efficiently36,39.\\nFig. 6\\nMobileNet-V2 architecture.\\nFull size image\\nVit transformer\\nThe Vision Transformer (ViT) employs transformer-based models that originally operated in natural language processing to perform image classification tasks. ViT operates differently than standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs) since it processes images as consecutive patches yet transforms them through transformer encoder layers. The image segmentation process starts by dividing it into fixed-sized non-intersecting blocks, after which these blocks become linearly arranged for positional encoding maintenance. The transformer structure of ViT allows the system to recognize image dependencies throughout the entire visual space, which enhances its performance in dataset-based image classification tasks. Scientific research demonstrates that ViT delivers better results than CNN-based models for big data analysis, according to Dosovitskiy et al. and Vaswani et al.40,41. Research demonstrates how pre-training large datasets before fine-tuning specifically for tasks shows ViT’s capacity for adaptable visual tasks. ViT has become a common choice in computer vision applications because it brings important performance and efficiency enhancements through modifications like DeiT (Data-efficient Image Transformer)42, which improves outcomes in smaller datasets by enhancing training data use.\\nProposed hybrid model\\nThe proposed model combines Convolutional Neural Networks with Vision Transformers as shown in Fig.\\xa07 to enhance facial image classification in autistic children. The CNN component utilizes ResNet152 as its base pre-trained on ImageNet43 to extract hierarchical spatial features. The model uses the fine-tuning approach that activates the last 20 layers of ResNet152 for parameter adjustment while keeping the previous layers static. The extracted CNN features pass through Global Average Pooling before entering two Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout layers, which bring randomization for correct feature selection. Google’s ViT-Base-Patch16 functions as the ViT model that conducts transformer-based tokenization on the same image while performing normalization and channel reordering procedures. The global average pooling process collects representative feature embeddings from the ViT’s final hidden state.\\nFig. 7\\nProposed hybrid model.\\nFull size image\\nThe fusion process begins when both network features combine in a concatenation layer and then proceed to a dense layer using ReLU activation to refine the features. A single sigmoid-activated neuron serves as the classification head after preceding it with an MC Dropout layer. The training process utilizes the Adam optimizer at a learning rate set to 0.0001 together with binary cross-entropy used as the loss function. The uncertainty estimation during inference depends on the use of MC Dropout because it generates multiple stochastic forward passes. This combined model architecture combines CNN spatial abilities with ViT long-range contextual understanding to enhance the recognition performance of autistic faces.\\nFigure\\xa08 presents diverse object images selected from the extensive ImageNet database that consists of various categories, including thousands of object classes. ImageNet functions as a fundamental reference database for deep learning investigations because it contains images for both classification and recognition objectives. This database provides researchers with a versatile choice of images that include both animal subjects and household items and natural scenes together with human actions and urban city views for educational purposes in deep learning model training and evaluation.\\nFig. 8\\nSamples of ImageNet database43.\\nFull size image\\nExperimental results\\nIn this section, we report the findings of the study with regards to the classification of autism-related learning difficulties in children using DenseNet201, ResNet152, VGG16, EfficientNet-B0, MobileNetV2, VGG19, and the proposed hybrid model. The criteria for assessment include accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and computational complexity. We also present the statistical values of the outcome to compare the significance of the variations between models. All the experiments were conducted with a learning rate of 0.0001, the epoch of 80 and 100, a batch size of 32, a seed of 42, and an image size\\u2009=\\u2009224\\u2009×\\u2009224. The experiment computer has a 64-bit operating system, an\\u2009×\\u200964-based processor, the Intel(R) Core (TM) i7-3612QM CPU 2.10 GHz and 2.1 GHz, and 10 GB RAM. Deep learning parameters used for all models are declared in Table 1.\\nTable 1 Sample of hyperparameters values.\\nFull size table\\nPerformance metrics\\nEach model was evaluated using a range of performance metrics to assess their ability to correctly classify instances of autism-related learning challenges. The metrics used include accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score. These metrics are defined as follows44:\\n$${\\\\text{Accuracy}} = \\\\left( {{\\\\text{TP}} + {\\\\text{TN}}} \\\\right)/\\\\left( {{\\\\text{TP}} + {\\\\text{FP}} + {\\\\text{TN}} + {\\\\text{FN}}} \\\\right)$$\\n(1)\\n$${\\\\text{Precision}} = {\\\\text{TP }}/ \\\\, \\\\left( {{\\\\text{TP }} + {\\\\text{ FP}}} \\\\right)$$\\n(2)\\n$${\\\\text{Recall}} = {\\\\text{TP }}/ \\\\, \\\\left( {{\\\\text{TP }} + {\\\\text{ FN}}} \\\\right)$$\\n(3)\\n$$F1{\\\\text{-}}{\\\\text{measure}} = 2{\\\\text{TP}}/(2{\\\\text{TP}} + {\\\\text{FP}} + {\\\\text{FN}})$$\\n(4)\\n$${\\\\text{Specificity}} = {\\\\text{TN }}/ \\\\, ({\\\\text{FP }} + {\\\\text{ TN}})$$\\n(5)\\nwhere, true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN) are critical as they represent how effective the model is. Accuracy quantifies the number of correct predictions out of all the birth outcomes. Recall, or sensitivity is the precision of correctly predicted positive cases. Recall shows the model’s sensitivity for the actual positives, expressed in the percentage of correctly identified cases. F1-measure unites precision and recall, which makes it possible to evaluate the model’s accuracy in terms of positive and negative instance identification. Specificity in data mining mainly addresses the aspect of accuracy in the model’s identification of negative cases.\\nDataset\\nThe dataset used for this research comes from Kaggle under the provision of45. The dataset includes primary visual data through facial images of children with and without autism that most officials obtained from websites linked to autism and Facebook pages. The predominant focus of data collection included European and United States children with minor representation from other global regions. The data distribution consists of identical quantities for male and female images from autistic children and non-autistic children. Uniform specifications must be applied to standardize the images of different sizes before the model can receive training.\\nEach image received three processing steps, including pixel normalization to the [0,1] scale and a 224\\u2009×\\u2009224 pixel resizing operation. The model received data augmentation through techniques that included image rotation and flipping as well as adjustments to image contrast, which improved model generalization while minimizing overfitting. The dataset division allocated 2540 images for training, 100 images for validation, and 300 images for testing. The feature extraction phase included using ResNet152 and Vision Transformer (ViT) models, which received additional processing methods optimized to work with each model. Standard normalization was applied for CNN-based models, yet per-image standardization served the ViT-based approach to maintain consistency. The preprocessing operations produced an organized dataset that succeeded in creating effective autism classification results.\\nThe images in Fig.\\xa09 showcase different facial images depicting children in two distinct categories for autism identification purposes. The classification separates autistic images into the top row and non-autistic images into the lower row. The presented samples showcase the differences across both categories regarding facial traits and expressions, thus demonstrating dataset variation.\\nFig. 9\\nSample of dataset images45.\\nFull size image\\nTable 2 presents the key hyperparameters utilized in the proposed model for autism classification. These hyperparameters were carefully selected to optimize the model’s performance while maintaining computational efficiency. The image size was standardized to (224, 224) pixels to ensure consistency across all inputs. A batch size of 16 was chosen to balance memory constraints and training stability. The model was trained for 100 epochs with a learning rate of 0.0001, employing the Adam optimizer to enhance convergence. Dropout was applied at a rate of 0.3 to mitigate overfitting, with Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout performing 20 passes for uncertainty estimation. Fine-tuning was restricted to the last 20 layers of ResNet152 to preserve pre-trained features while allowing domain adaptation. Data augmentation techniques, including rotation, flipping, and contrast adjustments, were applied to enhance generalization. The binary cross-entropy loss function was used to guide the model’s learning process.\\nTable 2 Values of hyperparameters used in the proposed model.\\nFull size table\\nResults\\nSeveral confusion matrices appear in Fig.\\xa010 that evaluate deep learning model classification performance for autistic and non-autistic identification using DenseNet-201, ResNet-152, VGG-16, EfficientNet-B0, MobileNet-V2, VGG-19, and a proposed hybrid model. The visual organization in the confusion matrix indicates true positive, positive, negative, and false negative scores of different prediction models. DenseNet-201 identifies 123 true positives, 7 true negatives, 27 false positives, and 23 false negatives; however, ResNet-152 outperforms slightly with 126 true positives, 143 true negatives, 7 false negatives, and 24 false positives. The two versions of VGG show matching trends as VGG-16 delivers 116 true positives along with 133 true negatives while misclassifying 34 instances as false positives and 17 instances as false negatives, yet VGG-19 shows 115 true positives combined with 122 true negatives alongside 35 false positives and 28 false negatives. The classification results show EfficientNet-B0 achieves better performance than MobileNet-V2 because it detects 125 true positives and 132 true negatives and produces 25 false positives and 18 false negatives, while MobileNet-V2 shows 116 true positives and 125 true negatives alongside 34 false positives and 25 false negatives. The proposed hybrid model surpasses every single model in tests by reaching maximum accuracy through 136 true positives together with 138 true negatives while keeping false positives at 14 instances and false negatives at 12 instances. The proposed hybrid model shows better classification results since it optimizes sensitivity and specificity to provide a more dependable solution for autism identification.\\nFig. 10\\nConfusion matrices.\\nFull size image\\nTable 3 demonstrates an extensive overview of deep learning model metrics and computational capacity by analyzing DenseNet-201, ResNet-152, VGG-16, EfficientNet-B0, MobileNet-V2, and VGG-19 together with the proposed hybrid system. All performance measures from the proposed hybrid model demonstrate the highest achievement, with accuracy reaching 91.33%, precision reaching 90.67%, and recall reaching 91.89%, along with an F1 measure of 91.28% and specificity of 90.79%. The model’s classification performance exceeds the levels of alternative models, which contributes to its superior ability to conduct this task. The proposed model demonstrates superior performance reliability based on its statistically significant results through T-test p-values (all 0.000) and ANOVA p-value (0.001). The hybrid model demonstrates a real-time inference speed of 15 ms, which enables its implementation for real-time clinical applications.\\nTable 3 Classification Report on pretrained model’s vs proposed hybrid model.\\nFull size table\\nThe evaluation reveals different trade-offs occur between the speed of computation and performance results between the various implemented models. The inference times exceed 70 ms for VGG-16 and 80 ms for VGG-19 despite achieving 83.00% and 79.00% accuracy levels, which limits their practical utilization. MobileNet-V2 and EfficientNet-B0 trade less precision (80.33% and 85.67%, respectively) for faster response times (10 ms and 15 ms, respectively). The proposed hybrid model reaches its peak performance by surpassing other approaches both in accuracy and F1 measure while maintaining speeds near those of EfficientNet-B0. The proposed model presents itself as a suitable solution for clinical workflows because it meets both performance standards and processing speed requirements.\\nFigure\\xa011 shows two graphs that depict the distinction between metrics of training and validation processes over 80 epochs for a machine learning-based solution. The left plot represents the training and validation loss, while the right plot represents the training and validation accuracy. Thus, we can observe that the training loss is continuously reducing over the epoch, signifying that the model is learning from the training data. On the other hand, the validation loss curve is also declining up to a certain epoch, after which the curve levels off, which indicates that the model is just beginning to over-train the training set.\\nFig. 11\\nAccuracy and loss for DensNet-201.\\nFull size image\\nThe right plot shows the training and validation accuracy; in this graph, the training accuracy is consistently improving and reaches up to 90%, which means the model fits very well to the training set. However, subsequently the validation accuracy rises and oscillates in the range of 70–83% which shows that the models’ ability to generalize on unseen data does not increase after this stage, suggesting signs of overfitting. The fact that there is a gap between the training and the validation sets means that we need to employ techniques such as regulation to enhance the generality of the models.\\nFigure\\xa012 contains two plots, where one plot illustrates the training and the validation metrics of a model on 80 epochs. The left plot is for training and validation loss where training loss is in a blue curve, and it traces a decreasing trend and moves closer to the zero line, which points out that the model is learning well from the training data. However, validation loss is still high and has great oscillations during the training, which indicates the model has a poor ability to predict new unseen data points and is probably overfitting. The fluctuating and jagged curve of validation loss reveals instability whereby the performance of the model tested on the validation set is unpredictable.\\nFig. 12\\nAccuracy and loss for ResNet-152.\\nFull size image\\nThe right plot depicts training and validation accuracy. The blue color of the curve shows that training accuracy is rapidly achieving near to the perfection level or above 95%, which implies the model is doing very well within the training set. On the other hand, the validation accuracy has much lower values that hover between 65 and 89% and does not seem to enhance as the training progresses beyond the first epochs. The difference between the training and the validation accuracy shows that even though the model performs well at ‘memorizing’ the training data, it does not generalize well to unseen data, which is further evidence of overfitting.\\nFigure\\xa013 shows two plots demonstrating the performance of the training and validation of a model indicating epochs to 80. The left plot captures training and validation loss; the training loss plot in blue shows that our model is learning from the training data through epochs. The same can be said for the validation loss, which also has a decreasing trend but at a slower rate that flattens out at around 0.7 after 50 epochs. This behavior implies that the model is able to learn and generalize well in the first phase, but at some point, it stalls in terms of learning from unseen data. The problem might, however, be slight overfitting. The right plot is called training and validation accuracy. As for training accuracy, these values grow constantly and are higher than 90% at the end of training, which means that the model works very well with the training set. On the other hand, the validation accuracy increases at a slower rate and stabilizes at around 81% and points to a difference in the performance between the training and the validation set.\\nFig. 13\\nAccuracy and loss for VGG-16.\\nFull size image\\nFigure\\xa014 clearly shows two curves depicting the training as well as validation of a model for each of the 80 epochs. The left plot is about training and validation loss. The training loss curve demonstrates the model’s ability to tackle the training dataset through the successive epochs of training. On the other hand, the validation loss stays high and varies significantly over the course of the training process. From the plot of validation loss, I observed that there is no significant downward pattern that should give indication that the model has good generalization on unseen data; hence, the model might be overfitting in the training data. It becomes even sharper, and fluctuations in the validation loss make the picture of the model’s performance on the validation set even more unstable.\\nFig. 14\\nAccuracy and loss for EfficientNet-B0.\\nFull size image\\nThe right plot indicates training and validation accuracy. The blue line represents training accuracy, which rises rapidly and gets very close to 100, meaning the model has very high accuracy with the training data set. Validation accuracy is much lower and unstable, always ranging between 70 and 85 percent, and does not rise even after the first few iterations. The difference between train accuracy and validation accuracy reveals overfitting is a major problem of the model.\\nFigure\\xa015 contains two graphs representing changes in the training and validation metrics of a model depending on the epoch. The left plot, Training and Validation Loss, reveals the fact that the training loss is getting smaller than epochs ranging from 0.65 to below 0.3, which shows that the model has an adequate capacity for learning from the training set. However, the validation loss remains high and fluctuates after periods indicating that the model fails to enhance the validation loss, instead revealing poor performance on unseen data. This constant difference between training and validation loss may raise an overfitting problem.\\nFig. 15\\nAccuracy and loss for MobileNet-V2.\\nFull size image\\nThe right plot illustrates training and validation accuracy. Training accuracy increases gradually and goes above 95%, which means the model’s accuracy is quite high if it’s applied to the training set. Nevertheless, validation accuracy, or the percentage of correct predictions, never goes close to 79 percent and varies in a non-concentric range of 65–79 percent. The difference in the training and validation accuracy, as well as the oscillatory nature of the model’s validation performance, also holds with the assessment that the model is overfitting the training examples.\\nFigure\\xa016, the first subplot represents training accuracy while the second subplot represents the validation accuracy, and both are represented over the number of epochs to 80. The left graph is about training and validation loss, in which training loss gradually decreases from roughly 0.7 to below 0.4, which shows that the model can learn from the training data used in this study. The validation loss also follows in their footsteps and decreases, but this happens at a slower pace and stabilizes around 0.65 after 40 epochs. The decline of both losses shows that this model is performing an impressive learning rate in the initial epochs of training; however, the stabilization of the validation loss signifies that it requires more boosting of the model to improve the generalization of unseen data.\\nFig. 16\\nAccuracy and loss for VGG-19.\\nFull size image\\nThe right plot is for training and validation accuracy. The training accuracy line, in blue color, is constantly rising, and it is more than 95 percent at the end of the training phase, showing that the model has a good interlace with the training data. Instead, the validation accuracy starts to increase at the beginning but then oscillates around 70–78%, which means that the model is not able to generalize as well as to the new data. The difference between the training accuracy and the validation accuracy shows signs of overfitting, where the model performs very well in training data but poorly in the new data.\\nFigure\\xa017 shows how a deep learning model performs on training and validation data throughout 100 epochs through accuracy trends on one graph and loss trends on another graph. The accuracy graph shows the training accuracy (blue line) rising quickly and then achieving stability near the value 1.0 in initial epochs, which demonstrates efficient model learning of training data. The validation accuracy (orange line) shows significant changes during the training period, which indicates that the model is overfitting because it fails to apply learned patterns to new unseen data points. The effort of the model toward minimizing training errors is confirmed by the decrease of the blue training loss line in the loss graph. Validation loss shows large volatility with multiple abrupt spikes across the training period, especially from the beginning until the middle stages of training. The model demonstrates overfitting behavior through its training of the data points effectively, yet its inability to predict unseen validation data. The ongoing increase in validation loss demonstrates that the model maintains excessive learning behavior during the latter training epochs. The constant descent of training loss (blue line) shows continuous progress while validation loss fails to show consistent improvement, thus proving that the network requires extra generalization capabilities.\\nFig. 17\\nAccuracy and loss for proposed hybrid model.\\nFull size image\\nOur approach added regularizations through dropout layers, batch normalization, and early stopping to block the model from memorizing random patterns in training data. The data augmentation methods used image rotation along with flipping and normalization functions to improve both robustness and data variability. The modified model produced enhanced validation loss patterns that displayed improved stability and decreased oscillations since the implemented strategies reinforced generalization strength. The revised model demonstrated enhanced validation accuracy consistency that matched training performance better, as it indicated improved adaptability to new data.\\nFigure\\xa018 display demonstrates how the test accuracy stands between three different models, which consist of Vision Transformer (ViT), ResNet152, and a combination of ViT and ResNet152. Each unit along the y-axis shows accuracy measurement between 0 and 1, yet the x-axis differentiates between the three models. The blue bar indicates the ViT model offers relatively strong accuracy yet does not reach the same level as the green bar depicting ResNet152 accuracy performance achievement. The combination of the ViT and ResNet152 models (shown as a red bar) reaches the best accuracy score among the three available models. The combination of ViT models with ResNet152 results in superior feature extraction abilities and classification skills, which generates better results when testing real data.\\nFig. 18\\nComparison vit, ResNet152 and hybrid for test accuracy.\\nFull size image\\nFigure\\xa019 shows which parts of the input photos affected the model prognosis most significantly. The model highlights important clinical indicators like facial features and symmetrical regions in the face during autism spectrum disorder classification. The model-based diagnostic decisions rest upon anatomical patterns that become visible through visualization methods, thus enabling trustworthy clinical deployment.\\nFig. 19\\nGrad-CAM heatmap.\\nFull size image\\nThe proposed hybrid deep learning system performance stands against traditional ASD diagnosis procedures and simpler machine learning models through the Table 4 evaluation. The current ASD diagnosis process depends on both the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), which need expert professionals and amount to lengthy examination times. Support Vector Machines (SVM) deliver subpar performance measurements because they do not work well across different situations. The model is tested against established diagnostic procedures for evaluation. The hybrid modeling system outperforms traditional techniques in all metrics by delivering higher accuracy as well as precision alongside recall and F1 scores and specificity.\\nTable 4 Comparison between the proposed hybrid deep learning model and traditional ASD diagnostic approaches.\\nFull size table\\nDiscussion\\nDeep learning models are a potential tool for detecting autism-related learning disabilities in children at an early stage. By studying DenseNet201, ResNet152, VGG16, EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, and VGG19 with transfer learning and fine-tuning, the author realized the strengths along with the limitations of each model for clinical use and its shortcomings.\\nResNet152 showed excellent performance with 89% accuracy, proving slightly better than VGG16, VGG19, MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB0, and DenseNet201 models in identifying children with autism-related learning disabilities from those without. The composite scaling method allows ResNet152 to achieve improved depth, accuracy, and width, resulting in its effective performance along with its efficacy. The harmonious combination of accuracy and efficiency makes ResNet152 an ideal solution for clinical purposes, especially within resource-strapped healthcare systems.\\nThe analysis through Table 5 examines deep learning model performance in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) detection through facial image assessments. The proposed hybrid model of ResNet152 with Vision Transformers (ViT) reaches a 91.33% accuracy level, surpassing the ViT-XGBoost-SHAP model (91.3%) presented by Karthik et al. (2024). Rahman and Subashini (2022) observed significant success when Xception delivered 90% accuracy, which outperformed MobileNet (84.67%) as well as EfficientNet variants (86.64–89.67%) in older research works. According to the research of Pranavi and Andrew (2024), EfficientNetB0 (87.9%) displayed superior performance compared to VGG16 (84.66%) and VGG19 (80.05%) in their evaluation of CNN architectures. The research paper by Hayder and Amir (2025) presented Enhanced Vision Transformers, which reached an 87.67% success rate in their tests. The analysis demonstrates that combined models with transformer capabilities offer superior performance for facial image diagnosis of ASD through their implementation.\\nTable 5 comparison table summarizing related studies on autism detection using deep learning models for publicly available dataset from Kaggle.\\nFull size table\\nThe proposed research developed a hybrid deep learning model that integrates Vision Transformer (ViT) with ResNet152 to improve classification accuracy. ViT-ResNet152 works by combining two architectures that enable ViT to exploit image-based relationships while ResNet152 applies its hierarchical nature to extract features. Experimental results showed that the combined vision model outperformed the results of the standalone network, indicating that the integration of Vision Transformer with traditional convolutional networks increases the accuracy of detecting autism-related learning disabilities. The successful implementation of this hybrid architecture demonstrates that the combination of multiple architectures produces better classification accuracy results with an accuracy of 91.33% along with improved dataset generalization capabilities and robust performance. The results from the AI model need external database tests together with inspections in authentic clinical settings to validate its final performance. These initial findings create a solid starting point, while researchers need to test the model further with various clinical settings to determine its generic use. Upcoming research requires collecting larger multi-site clinical data for testing practical clinical usage alongside real-time doctor assessments. The study demonstrates the future potential of deep learning models in ASD detection yet suggests more research should be conducted in this direction. AI tools need further development and validation before becoming valuable assets for early autism diagnosis.\\nThis study has some limitations because the dataset used does not include all potential autism patients. This scientific work emphasizes the value of artificial intelligence algorithms to reshape how clinicians identify autism-related learning disabilities at an early stage. These excellent diagnostic tools show sufficient accuracy and sensitivity, which means that this technology should be adopted by clinical programs to provide objective and timely diagnoses that reduce subjective assessments. Early detection and accurate diagnosis of learning disabilities are essential to implement the right interventions that lead to improved developmental outcomes for children with ASD. Moreover, geographic bias emerges because the primary participants in the dataset come from children in U.S. and European areas, while also reducing the model’s suitability toward diverse populations. The model’s widespread application becomes limited when its usefulness is reduced due to developmental differences between regions that are affected by genetic and environmental factors, along with cultural elements. The absence of representation from underrepresented global areas could produce unfavorable diagnostic performance results when the model processes children from non-Western countries.\\nAlthough they provide a powerful set of examples. ASD is characterized by diverse manifestations and multiple symptoms, creating complexity in diagnosing the condition, while model performance can vary based on different data types beyond basic imaging and different patient populations. Transfer learning requires the use of pre-trained models with biases from the ImageNet dataset that may fail to match the RGB images and behavioral dataset of this study. Performance improves when we train our models with expanded and diverse dataset information. The analysis in this work performs a general model comparison by evaluating six deep learning models but fails to identify potential improvements from newer models or hybrid architecture solutions.\\nConclusion\\nThe paper indicates that deep learning technology successfully identifies autism-related learning disabilities in young children at an early stage. ResNet-152 proved to be the most successful autonomous model according to research outcomes after implementing transfer learning methods through fine-tuning six pre-trained convolutional neural networks consisting of DenseNet-201, ResNet-152, VGG16, VGG19, MobileNet-V2, and EfficientNet-B0. The model reached 89% accuracy. Safer and more effective approaches can be built from Vision Transformer (ViT) models united with ResNet-152 structures, even though these approaches show potential yet possess two critical problems stemming from pre-trained ImageNet dataset biases alongside the restriction to identify diverse autism spectrum disorder conditions. The ViT-ResNet152 model achieves better dataset generalization with increased classification accuracy by blending the Vision Transformer global attention model with ResNet-152 hierarchical feature extraction characteristics. Experimental tests confirmed that uniting both structures led to maximum accuracy, reaching 91.33% in detection results. As demonstrated by this hybrid network design, transformers integrated into traditional convolutional models improve the accuracy and reliability of ASD detection algorithms. Medical assessments find precise, scalable support from AI ensemble learning tools that work with specific approaches to reduce dependence on clinical judgment. In future work, the development of ensemble frameworks and expanded autism spectrum disorder dataset collection should receive attention from future research initiatives to improve both accuracy and eliminate biases in generalization outcomes. The diagnostic precision will increase through the addition of speech patterns, eye-tracking, behavioral assessments, and image-based features, which offer extra autism-related indicators. The validation of AI-based autism detection tools requires medical expert partnership and clinical professional collaboration to ensure their real-world reliability and effectiveness. Real-world healthcare deployment of clinical trial-tested models in hospitals will close experimental research-practical application gaps, making these technologies more dependable and impactful in real-world healthcare environments.\\nData availability\\nAvailable online: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cihan063/autism-image-data.\\nReferences\\nLord, C., Elsabbagh, M., Baird, G. & Veenstra-Vanderweele, J.

Of those, a little more than a third said they don’t want to receive such training.\\nThe most cited reason? They don’t think AI should be used to teach math to students, according to a nationally representative survey of 411 math teachers conducted in February.\\nSee Also\\nOpen image caption\\nClose image caption\\nStephanie Dalton Cowan for Education Week\\nSpecial Report Math & AI: Can They Work Together?\\nMarch 24, 2025\\n“AI takes the thinking away from students and they think it is the answer to everything,” a math teacher in Wisconsin said in an open-ended response to the survey. “There should be LESS automation and MORE thinking.”\\nSimilarly, a RAND report published in February found that math and elementary teachers are less likely to say they use AI tools or products for instructional planning or teaching than English/language arts, science, and secondary teachers.\\nA Flourish chart\\nMath teachers’ reluctance to try this emerging technology is not surprising, said Gail Burrill, a mathematics specialist in the math education program at Michigan State University and a former president of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.\\nComputer-assisted algebra and other algorithmic math tools have been around for a long time, but teachers “have been struggling with” how to integrate those technologies into the classroom, Burrill said.\\nOne reason that some math teachers aren’t excited about AI is that teaching math often relies on drilling students on questions on worksheets, said Pat Yongpradit, chief academic officer of Code.org and the lead for the TeachAI initiative. With that model, students can easily use AI to answer questions, he said.\\nAnother reason, Yongpradit said, is that current generative AI models still make a lot of mistakes with math, making teachers distrust the technology.\\n“Even when AI does get it right, it often fails to explain the steps it used to get the right answer,” he said. “This is a double whammy for the effectiveness of using AI in math instruction—math is not just about the right answer, it’s also about the process.”\\nOne way to get buy-in from math teachers is to cast AI in a different light and show powerful use cases that make learning better, Yongpradit said.\\nBelow is a chart with the other reasons why math teachers say they don’t want professional development on AI:\\nA Flourish table\\nLauraine Langreo\\nfollow Unfollow\\nStaff Writer,\\xa0 Education Week\\nLauraine Langreo is an Education Week staff writer, covering education technology and learning environments.\\ntwitter\\nemail\\nlinkedin\\nMost Popular Stories\\nOpen image caption\\nClose image caption\\nErin Huff, a 24-year-old kindergarten teacher at Waverly Elementary in Illinois, pictured here on Dec. 18, 2019, says low pay, high stress, and heavy workloads often discourage young people from entering teacher preparation programs.

But what do these terms really mean for manufacturing operations, and how are they different from the machine learning many are already familiar with? This episode of Great Question: A Manufacturing Podcast cuts through the hype. Join New Equipment Digest Editor-in-Chief Laura Davis as she breaks down the distinctions between key AI types, explores how each is impacting areas like product design, quality control, smart factories, and logistics, and addresses the critical questions around implementation challenges and strategic adoption. Listen now to understand the real potential beyond the buzzwords.\\nBelow is an excerpt from the podcast:\\nThere's no doubt about it, artificial intelligence is really shaping this decade. It's popping up everywhere, across practically every industry, making things more convenient and opening doors we probably haven't even thought of yet. Now, for manufacturing, we've already seen huge leaps in efficiency thanks to Industry 4.0 and automation, right? Well, AI is really the next big wave. In fact, Tom Coshow over at Gartner predicts that by 2028, AI agents—not people—will be making about 15% of routine business decisions all on their own.\\nThat's a huge shift, especially for manufacturing. But to really grasp how AI will achieve this on the factory floor, we first need to get clear on what we mean by 'AI'. It's not just one thing. You've probably heard terms like 'Generative AI' and 'Agentic AI' thrown around, alongside the machine learning many are already familiar with. Let's break down what these different types are and how they fit into the manufacturing picture.\\nSo the big terms you keep hearing are Generative AI and Agentic AI. And it's important to know they're not the same thing.\\nBefore these newer types hit the headlines, many in manufacturing were already using AI, specifically machine learning. Think of machine learning as being focused mostly on prediction—it looks at data, finds patterns, and uses rules we give it to solve specific problems. You see it in predictive analytics, understanding language—that's natural language processing or NLP—and even some basic autonomous systems.\\nThen you have Generative AI. It also learns from data, but its main job is to create something new based on those patterns. This is the AI that writes text, generates images, maybe even composes music, or designs product models. Think ChatGPT, Claude, DALL-E, Midjourney—those tools that exploded onto the scene? That's Generative AI. It's great for mimicking human-like creative work and can be a real time-saver.\\nTom Coshow over at Gartner predicts that by 2028, AI agents—not people—will be making about 15% of routine business decisions all on their own.\\nNow, Agentic AI is built to interact with the world around it, make decisions, and actually do things to reach a goal—all by itself, no human constantly telling it what to do. That's a key difference from Generative AI, which usually needs a human prompt to get started.\\nFor Agentic AI, think about a self-driving car figuring out traffic based on its sensors, or a robot arm in a warehouse picking and sorting items on its own, or even a smart assistant that manages your calendar without you asking. These systems use sensors to 'see' or 'feel' their surroundings, algorithms to 'think,' and actuators to 'act'.\\nThe core idea with Agentic AI is that it has a goal. It doesn't just react; it considers its objectives and makes choices to get there. This is the type of AI people sometimes joke about taking over because it can act independently. That independence naturally brings up serious questions about ethics and accountability. Like, who's responsible if it messes up? How do we ensure it stays aligned with what we want it to do? Developers are definitely grappling with this, building in safeguards to keep things on track.\\nSo, another way to think about the difference is scope. Generative AI is usually focused on specific, well-defined creative tasks. Agentic AI often tackles bigger, more complex goals that might require multiple steps and constant adjustments along the way. The simple takeaway? Generative AI generates, Agentic AI acts.\\nKeep listening\\nSo, remember that key difference: Generative AI generates, Agentic AI acts. And often, as we'll see, they can even work together. With that foundation laid, let's explore the interesting part: what does this look like in practice today? Where is AI already making a tangible impact on the manufacturing floor?\\nWhen you start combining AI—whether it's machine learning, generative, or agentic—with things like computer vision or natural language processing, you can speed up process improvements like never before. One of its superpowers is crunching massive amounts of data. And I don't just mean looking at numbers—I mean digging through everything, finding hidden patterns, learning constantly, figuring out what it all means, and then telling you what to do next, or even doing it itself, often in seconds. Plus, it's adaptable. Because it's based on algorithms, it can react to changes happening right now—data pouring in from sensors, machines, maybe your whole production line.\\nAbout the PodcastGreat Question: A Manufacturing Podcast offers news and information for the people who make, store and move things and those who manage and maintain the facilities where that work gets done.

Here’s what job hunters should know - CNN', 'image_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gehr_zCvivo/maxresdefault.jpg', 'raw_content': 'CNN values your feedback\\nMarkets\\nHot Stocks\\nFear & Greed Index\\nLatest Market News\\nHot Stocks\\nAI might be scanning your resume. Here’s what job hunters should know\\nFollow:\\nApplying for a new job? A human resources representative or hiring manager may not be the first to review your resume. Instead, it might be an AI-powered tool.\\nWith some job postings attracting hundreds or thousands of applications, companies are increasingly using AI to sort through applicants before they reach a human recruiter. According to data from jobseeker resource site Resume Genius, 48% of hiring managers report using AI to screen resumes and applications, and the AI recruitment sector is expected to experience a compound annual growth rate of 6.1% between 2023 and 2030, according to the Society for Human Resources Management.\\nWhile companies have long been using applicant tracking systems (ATS) to parse resumes for skills and keywords, AI has the potential to further automate the process by “reading” resumes and applications to find suitable candidates.\\nBut can that make it more difficult to guarantee a resume gets seen by a human? Experts say AI can benefit both recruiters and candidates by allowing applications to be “seen” in their entirety by the algorithm, reducing reliance on keyword-scanning methods that may penalize candidates for omitting specific words from their resumes.\\nGoing beyond keywords\\nThe practice of including keywords from a job posting in a resume isn’t new. For example, an applicant may put the coding languages Python or C++ on their resume for software engineering jobs that require those skills, ideally improving their chances of being picked up by automated systems.\\nBut new AI tools can understand the content of a resume, meaning they can help spot candidates even if their resumes don’t mention certain words, said Madeline Laurano, chief analyst at Aptitude Research, an HR advisory firm.\\n“The AI providers take a skills-based approach,” said Laurano. “They’re saying, ‘We’re not using keywords on a resume. We want to be able to create more of a holistic picture and a full view of the individual, so we’re inferring skills.’”\\nThe system can then provide hiring managers with a list of relevant candidates and rank them, which Laurano says benefits both hirers and recruiters by helping them save time.\\nThe idea that automated tools just toss away resumes is a misconception, Nathan Soto, a career expert at Resume Genius, told CNN. Soto added that “most HR representatives or hiring managers say they still look at the resumes.” But hiring managers often need the help because they’re flooded with applications, some of which may be AI-generated.\\n“They have no choice but to use AI to sort through that stuff,” Soto said. “The sheer number of applications that they’re getting has been rising.”\\nStill, it’s important to remember the basics: Make sure the skills outlined on your resume match the job posting, and avoid complex visuals such as charts, columns or unusual fonts.\\n“Unfortunately, the more boring it looks to the human eye, that’s what the ATS craves,” said Soto.\\nAI recruiting agents are coming\\nBeyond using AI to read resumes, recruiting firms are using the technology to simplify the hiring process.\\nLast year, human resources software provider Workday acquired AI hiring tool developer HiredScore, and Indeed released a Smart Sourcing tool that can find candidates and draft outreach messages.\\nLinkedIn took that idea one step further in October when it introduced an AI agent for handling mundane HR tasks such as screening applications. Hiring managers tell the agent, called Hiring Assistant, the type of candidate they’re seeking, and LinkedIn’s AI helper provides a list of top contenders sourced from applicants or the network’s profiles. A recruiter can even point the assistant to a current employee and ask it to find similar candidates.\\nThe tool can also chat with applicants during off hours, although the human recruiter can enter the chat if needed.\\n“One of the real challenges about being a recruiter today is that a lot of the job has to be done in (the) evenings and (at) night,” Hari Srinivasan, vice president of product at LinkedIn, told CNN.\\nThe candidate will always know when they are chatting with a bot, Srinivasan said.\\nBut it’s not just recruiters; LinkedIn hopes to make the process easier for job seekers, too. LinkedIn is working on a tool that would allow job hunters to type in a description of their desired role rather than searching for a specific job title. One example, according to Srinivasan, could include a search like: “Find me a job where I can work on a mission to go to space,” and the system would display relevant results.\\nThe company is currently testing this tool with LinkedIn Premium subscribers.\\n“All of a sudden the amount of opportunities you have starts opening up,” he said.\\nAnother AI feature, Job Match, tells jobseekers whether their experience aligns with a certain role, which Srinivasan said can help them find the most relevant positions rather than mass-applying to posts.\\nA spokesperson for LinkedIn said Hiring Assistant is currently being used by a few hundred LinkedIn Recruiter customers and will be rolled out more broadly this fall.\\nBut as advanced as AI may be, it’s still prone to bias. Research from the University of Washington, for example, found that three large language models (LLMs) used in hiring more frequently favored resumes submitted by people with white-associated names than Black-associated names.\\nRelated article\\nAI tools make things up a lot, and that’s a huge problem\\nAI also sometimes outputs false information, known as “hallucinating,” so it could potentially misunderstand an applicant’s resume and provide incorrect information to a recruiter.\\nIt’s also important for candidates to consent to their data being processed by AI, Laurano added.\\nWhile AI tools like Hiring Assistant can help eliminate “friction” in the hiring process, finding the right hire will always require a human touch.\\n“AI should not be making a decision on hiring,” Laurano said. “At the end of the day, a human needs to make a decision.”\\nCNN Business Videos\\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

It\\'s going to be automated. And great Americans, the tradecraft of America is going to fix them, is going to work on them. There\\'s gonna be mechanics, there\\'s gonna be HVAC specialists, there\\'s gonna be electricians.\"\\n\"The tradecraft of America, our high school educated Americans, the core to our workforce, is going to have the greatest resurgence of jobs in the history of America to work on these high-tech factories.\"\\nLutnick isn\\'t totally clear here. But it sounds like he\\'s saying iPhone manufacturing will move to the U.S. but will be automated.\\nAmericans won\\'t work in the factories like their Chinese predecessors tightening all those tiny screws; instead, Americans will work on the factories, building and maintaining them.\\nPut aside what Apple experts say about the impossibility of building iPhones in the U.S. without tripling their price. Just consider what this scenario actually means for American workers.\\nYou can\\'t have \"the greatest resurgence of jobs in the history of America\" if you\\'re automating all the manufacturing.\\nThe more likely scenario is a broad economic slowdown, with the AI industry, along with the rest of the U.S. economy, mired in the doldrums of uncertainty and fear.\\nA tariff-induced inflation jolt, a trade-war-fueled recession, or both together would radically limit the runway for AI startups and dry up the dollars flowing into AI research.\\nThe bottom line: The biggest companies — Microsoft, Google, Apple and Meta — all have enough cash flow and reserves to weather such a storm.

This fully encrypted mainframe is powered by an IBM Telum II processor and is designed for more than 250 AI use cases, the company says, including AI agents and generative AI.\\nMainframes might seem like old hat, but they’re used by 71% of Fortune 500 companies today, according to one source. In 2024, the mainframe market was worth an estimated $5.3 billion, per consulting firm Market Research Future.\\nThe z17 can process 450 billion inference operations in a day, a 50% increase over its predecessor, the IBM z16, which was released in 2022 and ran on the company’s original Tellum processor. The system is designed to be able to fully integrate with other hardware, software, and open-source tools.\\nTina Tarquinio, VP of product management and design for IBM Z, told TechCrunch that this mainframe upgrade has been in the works for five years —\\xa0well before the current AI frenzy that started with the release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November 2022.\\nIBM spent more than 2,000 research hours getting feedback from over 100 customers as it built the z17, Tarquinio said. She thinks it’s interesting to see that, now, five years later, the feedback they got aligned with where the market ended up heading.\\n“It has been wild knowing that we’re introducing an AI accelerator, and then seeing, especially in the later half of 2022, all of the changes in the industry regarding AI,” Tarquinio told TechCrunch. “It’s been really exciting. I think the biggest point has been [that] we don’t know what we don’t know about what’s coming, right? So the possibilities are really unlimited in terms of what AI can help us do.”\\nSrtictlyVC London\\nStrictlyVC is coming to London!

Join us and be part of the movement shaping the future of innovation.\\nLondon | May 13\\nREGISTER NOW\\nThe z17 is set up to adapt and accommodate where the AI market heads, Tarquinio said. The mainframe will support 48 IBM Spyre AI accelerator chips upon release, with the plan to bring that number up to 96 within 12 months.\\n“We are purposely building in headroom,” Tarquinio said. “We’re purposely building in AI agility. So as new models are introduced, [we’re] making sure that we’ve built in the headroom for bigger, larger models — models that maybe need more local memory to talk to each other. We’ve built in that because we know it’s really the approach that will change, right? The new models will come and go.”\\nTarquinio said that one of the highlights of this latest hardware — although she joked it was like being asked to pick her favorite child — is that the z17 is more energy-efficient than its predecessor and supposedly competitors, too.\\n“On-chip, we’re increasing the AI acceleration by seven and a half times, but that’s five and a half times less energy than you would need to do, like, multi-model on another type of accelerator or platform in the industry,” Tarquinio said.\\nThe z17 mainframes will become generally available on June 8.\\nTopics\\nAI, AI hardware, ai infrastructure, Enterprise, Hardware, IBM, mainframe, United States\\nRebecca Szkutak\\nSenior Reporter, Venture\\nBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

With agentic AI, the \"standards went up fast,\" Jonathan Userovici, general partner at VC firm Headline, told Business Insider.\\n\"Investors don\\'t just want to be impressed — they want to be educated, convinced, and excited. Your deck has to do all three,\" he said.\\nBI examined the pitch decks used by founders of five agentic AI startups to gauge what makes a successful presentation.\\nHere are three things the decks had in common — and what investors think would make a standout slideshow.\\nHighlight a community and network of supporters and users\\nBreakout\\nHaving a stamp of approval from advisors from top companies gives investors another avenue to conduct their due diligence and suggests the product is trusted and used by industry heavyweights.\\nBreakout, a startup that has launched AI sales agents, clearly outlines some key figures backing its mission in its deck. With $3.25 million in fresh funding under its belt, the company is looking to manage software companies\\' inbound sales.\\nOptimHire\\nSimilarly, OptimHire, a startup replacing recruiters with AI agents, showcased the agencies it has matched its product with — highlighting a strong product-market fit. It raised $5 million in March using this pitch deck.\\nClearly outline a specific solution to an existing market problem\\nDeckmatch\\nDeckmatch, a startup that allows private market investors to automate their work, vividly presents a key issue in the market — the way unstructured data makes workflow less efficient when deal sourcing. It goes on to outline solutions to the issue in a deck that helped it bag $3.1 million in seed funding in November 2024.\\nDeckmatch\\nThis slide exemplifies three ways in which the startup would combat the issue of unstructured data and how its platform could be integrated into the likes of email and WhatsApp.\\nOptimHire\\nSimilarly, OptimHire also pointed to tangible ways in which its platform has served its users — by cutting the number of hours needed to screen profiles and schedule interviews.\\nShow retention and budget replacement\\nAuxia\\nRevenue and pricing metrics are a key staple in any good pitch deck — but startups should clarify the long-term value-add their platform presents.\\nUserovici says retention is the new annual recurring revenue, or ARR.\\n\"Many AI apps, especially the \\'prosumer\\' ones, spike immediately as users rush to try them,\" said Userovici, referring to individuals who consume and produce. \"The world is full of flashy demos; retention is your proof of reality. Great decks lean into that.\"\\nAuxia, a startup that\\'s developed an AI agent for marketing and sales, raised a combined funding round totaling $23.5 million in March.\\nIts deck highlighted its consistent growth trajectory over nine months, showcasing how the product is retained beyond an initial use case.\\nGenie AI\\nGenie AI, a legal tech startup that\\'s built an AI agent for law firms, raised nearly $18 million in a round led by Google Ventures in October 2024.\\nIts pitch deck not only demonstrates strong customer retention but also explains how its platform offers strategic value to companies — something investors are keen to see in decks.\\nGenie AI\\n\"We\\'re seeing a shift in pricing as well. Winning AI founders price like they\\'re replacing a budget — not just selling a tool. Show us the math behind it,\" Userovici told BI.\\n\"Anchor it to value, savings, or new revenue. Highlight what you replace, not just what you add,\" he added. \"Show us which outsourced services, tools, or vendors you\\'re eliminating. In a way, traditional SaaS was sold to the CIO.

But what do these terms really mean for manufacturing operations, and how are they different from the machine learning many are already familiar with? This episode of Great Question: A Manufacturing Podcast cuts through the hype. Join New Equipment Digest Editor-in-Chief Laura Davis as she breaks down the distinctions between key AI types, explores how each is impacting areas like product design, quality control, smart factories, and logistics, and addresses the critical questions around implementation challenges and strategic adoption. Listen now to understand the real potential beyond the buzzwords.\\nBelow is an excerpt from the podcast:\\nThere's no doubt about it, artificial intelligence is really shaping this decade. It's popping up everywhere, across practically every industry, making things more convenient and opening doors we probably haven't even thought of yet. Now, for manufacturing, we've already seen huge leaps in efficiency thanks to Industry 4.0 and automation, right? Well, AI is really the next big wave. In fact, Tom Coshow over at Gartner predicts that by 2028, AI agents—not people—will be making about 15% of routine business decisions all on their own.\\nThat's a huge shift, especially for manufacturing. But to really grasp how AI will achieve this on the factory floor, we first need to get clear on what we mean by 'AI'. It's not just one thing. You've probably heard terms like 'Generative AI' and 'Agentic AI' thrown around, alongside the machine learning many are already familiar with. Let's break down what these different types are and how they fit into the manufacturing picture.\\nSo the big terms you keep hearing are Generative AI and Agentic AI. And it's important to know they're not the same thing.\\nBefore these newer types hit the headlines, many in manufacturing were already using AI, specifically machine learning. Think of machine learning as being focused mostly on prediction—it looks at data, finds patterns, and uses rules we give it to solve specific problems. You see it in predictive analytics, understanding language—that's natural language processing or NLP—and even some basic autonomous systems.\\nThen you have Generative AI. It also learns from data, but its main job is to create something new based on those patterns. This is the AI that writes text, generates images, maybe even composes music, or designs product models. Think ChatGPT, Claude, DALL-E, Midjourney—those tools that exploded onto the scene? That's Generative AI. It's great for mimicking human-like creative work and can be a real time-saver.\\nTom Coshow over at Gartner predicts that by 2028, AI agents—not people—will be making about 15% of routine business decisions all on their own.\\nNow, Agentic AI is built to interact with the world around it, make decisions, and actually do things to reach a goal—all by itself, no human constantly telling it what to do. That's a key difference from Generative AI, which usually needs a human prompt to get started.\\nFor Agentic AI, think about a self-driving car figuring out traffic based on its sensors, or a robot arm in a warehouse picking and sorting items on its own, or even a smart assistant that manages your calendar without you asking. These systems use sensors to 'see' or 'feel' their surroundings, algorithms to 'think,' and actuators to 'act'.\\nThe core idea with Agentic AI is that it has a goal. It doesn't just react; it considers its objectives and makes choices to get there. This is the type of AI people sometimes joke about taking over because it can act independently. That independence naturally brings up serious questions about ethics and accountability. Like, who's responsible if it messes up? How do we ensure it stays aligned with what we want it to do? Developers are definitely grappling with this, building in safeguards to keep things on track.\\nSo, another way to think about the difference is scope. Generative AI is usually focused on specific, well-defined creative tasks. Agentic AI often tackles bigger, more complex goals that might require multiple steps and constant adjustments along the way. The simple takeaway? Generative AI generates, Agentic AI acts.\\nKeep listening\\nSo, remember that key difference: Generative AI generates, Agentic AI acts. And often, as we'll see, they can even work together. With that foundation laid, let's explore the interesting part: what does this look like in practice today? Where is AI already making a tangible impact on the manufacturing floor?\\nWhen you start combining AI—whether it's machine learning, generative, or agentic—with things like computer vision or natural language processing, you can speed up process improvements like never before. One of its superpowers is crunching massive amounts of data. And I don't just mean looking at numbers—I mean digging through everything, finding hidden patterns, learning constantly, figuring out what it all means, and then telling you what to do next, or even doing it itself, often in seconds. Plus, it's adaptable. Because it's based on algorithms, it can react to changes happening right now—data pouring in from sensors, machines, maybe your whole production line.\\nAbout the PodcastGreat Question: A Manufacturing Podcast offers news and information for the people who make, store and move things and those who manage and maintain the facilities where that work gets done.

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\\nAgentic AI startups are attracting significant investor interest and raising notable funding rounds.\\nBusiness Insider analyzed five buzzy startup decks to gauge what makes a successful presentation.\\nThese pitch decks, shared with BI, had three key features in common.\\nVCs are keen to back agentic AI startups developing systems that can autonomously make decisions and perform tasks.\\nBut in a crowded field, what grabs investors\\' attention?\\nPitch decks are a vital part of any startup fundraising process. With agentic AI, the \"standards went up fast,\" Jonathan Userovici, general partner at VC firm Headline, told Business Insider.\\n\"Investors don\\'t just want to be impressed — they want to be educated, convinced, and excited. Your deck has to do all three,\" he said.\\nBI examined the pitch decks used by founders of five agentic AI startups to gauge what makes a successful presentation.\\nHere are three things the decks had in common — and what investors think would make a standout slideshow.\\nHighlight a community and network of supporters and users\\nBreakout\\nHaving a stamp of approval from advisors from top companies gives investors another avenue to conduct their due diligence and suggests the product is trusted and used by industry heavyweights.\\nBreakout, a startup that has launched AI sales agents, clearly outlines some key figures backing its mission in its deck. With $3.25 million in fresh funding under its belt, the company is looking to manage software companies\\' inbound sales.\\nOptimHire\\nSimilarly, OptimHire, a startup replacing recruiters with AI agents, showcased the agencies it has matched its product with — highlighting a strong product-market fit. It raised $5 million in March using this pitch deck.\\nClearly outline a specific solution to an existing market problem\\nDeckmatch\\nDeckmatch, a startup that allows private market investors to automate their work, vividly presents a key issue in the market — the way unstructured data makes workflow less efficient when deal sourcing. It goes on to outline solutions to the issue in a deck that helped it bag $3.1 million in seed funding in November 2024.\\nDeckmatch\\nThis slide exemplifies three ways in which the startup would combat the issue of unstructured data and how its platform could be integrated into the likes of email and WhatsApp.\\nOptimHire\\nSimilarly, OptimHire also pointed to tangible ways in which its platform has served its users — by cutting the number of hours needed to screen profiles and schedule interviews.\\nShow retention and budget replacement\\nAuxia\\nRevenue and pricing metrics are a key staple in any good pitch deck — but startups should clarify the long-term value-add their platform presents.\\nUserovici says retention is the new annual recurring revenue, or ARR.\\n\"Many AI apps, especially the \\'prosumer\\' ones, spike immediately as users rush to try them,\" said Userovici, referring to individuals who consume and produce. \"The world is full of flashy demos; retention is your proof of reality. Great decks lean into that.\"\\nAuxia, a startup that\\'s developed an AI agent for marketing and sales, raised a combined funding round totaling $23.5 million in March.\\nIts deck highlighted its consistent growth trajectory over nine months, showcasing how the product is retained beyond an initial use case.\\nGenie AI\\nGenie AI, a legal tech startup that\\'s built an AI agent for law firms, raised nearly $18 million in a round led by Google Ventures in October 2024.\\nIts pitch deck not only demonstrates strong customer retention but also explains how its platform offers strategic value to companies — something investors are keen to see in decks.\\nGenie AI\\n\"We\\'re seeing a shift in pricing as well. Winning AI founders price like they\\'re replacing a budget — not just selling a tool. Show us the math behind it,\" Userovici told BI.\\n\"Anchor it to value, savings, or new revenue. Highlight what you replace, not just what you add,\" he added. \"Show us which outsourced services, tools, or vendors you\\'re eliminating. In a way, traditional SaaS was sold to the CIO. AI sells to the operators.\"\\nRecommended video\\nPitch Deck\\nVenture Capital\\nStartups\\nRead next\\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\nHOME Subscribe\\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers.

The record fundraising and the goal of capitalizing on foreign investment interest in the U.S. tech industry come against the backdrop of a sweeping tariff plan by President Donald Trump to urge companies to manufacture goods in the U.S.\\nTo raise such a large amount of capital, a16z has been pitching it around the world. International LPs see the fund as a way to invest their money more easily into American AI companies without restrictions, one of the sources said.\\nAndreessen Horowitz did not reply to requests for comment.\\nA16z's founders, venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, announced last year they would support Trump, breaking with their traditional support for Democratic candidates, a sentiment shared by other prominent Silicon Valley figures such as Elon Musk.\\nEven by the standards of a firm known for raising some of Silicon Valley's largest investment vehicles, the new fund would represent a colossal step up in scale. It would test LPs' interest in venture capital amid global economic turmoil and continue the debate over how scalable this asset class is while maintaining appealing returns.\\nIf successfully raised, the new megafund would be surpassed only by SoftBank's two Vision funds, a massive experiment by deploying unprecedented amounts of capital into the tech sector, which has yielded mixed results. SoftBank Vision Fund 1, launched in 2017, was a record-breaking $100 billion fund, while its successor, Vision Fund 2, manages about $56 billion from SoftBank's balance sheet. Another Silicon Valley venture capital firm, Sequoia Capital, has over $56 billion in assets under management across multiple funds, with its evergreen fund growing to $19.6 billion this year, according to filings.\\nA16z's largest fund to date is a $5 billion growth-stage fund it raised as part of a $9 billion fundraise it announced in early 2022. It similarly asked LPs to commit capital into a grab bag of funds, each focused on a different sector or stage of startup maturity, to secure a $7.2 billion haul in 2024, $3.75 billion for a growth fund.\\nThe new fund, in its early stage, could take several months to close. Some LPs are drawn to the performance of its previous large funds, including one dedicated to cryptocurrency investments, as well as a16z's close ties with the Trump administration, one source said.\\nA sizable chunk of the capital would be set aside for follow-on investments into AI companies in the firm's portfolio, one source told Reuters. A16z was an early backer in some of today's hottest AI companies including Databricks and Musk's xAI, and has continued to participate in their multibillion-dollar growth-stage fundraising rounds.\\nThe firm is asking LPs to back a single vehicle instead of several across different sectors, underscoring both venture capitalists' obsession with artificial intelligence, and the massive capital demands of companies — in particular among those building large language models that require major amounts of computing power and data.\\nA16z has already been aggressive in backing numerous companies in the field, participating billion-dollar funding rounds as a lead investor in AI model developer startups including xAI, Safe Superintelligence and France-based Mistral. It has also purchased shares of OpenAI through a tender offer in the secondary transaction market.\\nFounded in 2009, a16z announced itself with a loud attitude and ambitions to disrupt the venture capital industry by going bigger. It raised funds larger than the industry norm and outbid traditional blue-chip investors to win stakes in promising startups, further sweetening the deal by hiring a legion of staff to provide support for those companies.\\nThe first $300 million fund was considered an enormous debut fund at the time. A16z now manages $45 billion of assets under management, according to its website. It became a registered investment advisor in 2019, gaining more flexibility in investment style beyond the traditional VC. The firm runs several sector-specific funds that invest in categories such as biotechnology, cryptocurrency and defense tech.\\nFor AI companies, it recently put together a cluster of thousands of Nvidia's GPUs that it advertised for rent to startups in its investment portfolio that might otherwise have difficulty securing access to the chips.\\n(Reporting by Kenrick Cai and Anna Tong in San Francisco and Krystal Hu in New York; Editing by Kenneth Li and Matthew Lewis)\\nRecommended Stories\\nSign in to access your portfolio\"}, {'title': \"First look: a16z's $20b fund, insect protein, and a Stada IPO - Axios\", 'image_url': 'https://cdn.aitimes.com/news/photo/202102/136245_135145_3051.png', 'raw_content': 'Published Time: 2025-04-08T20:18:41.479854Z\\nFirst look: a16z\\'s $20b fund, insect protein, and a Stada IPO\\nManage your consent preferences\\nWe use cookies and similar methods to recognize visitors and remember their preferences.

More (Photo Illustration by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)\\nAmazon\\'s new \"Buy For Me\" feature represents a stunning departure from the company\\'s decades-long strategy of keeping customers within its walled garden. By enabling AI agents to purchase products directly from brand websites when items aren\\'t available on Amazon, the retail giant is sacrificing short-term transaction revenue to maintain its position as consumers\\' first stop in an increasingly AI-driven shopping landscape.\\nThe feature, announced last week, is in beta for select U.S. customers, helps shoppers \"discover and seamlessly purchase select products from other brands\\' sites if those items are not currently sold in Amazon\\'s store,\" according to Amazon\\'s announcement. What makes this particularly remarkable is how it contradicts Amazon\\'s traditional approach to e-commerce.\\nBreaking Its Own Rules\\nScot Wingo, co-founder and CEO of ecommerce tech startup ReFiBuy and former CEO of ChannelAdvisor, called the initiative ‘bonkers,’ saying that Amazon has spent 31 years building a ‘fortress’ – a meticulously constructed a walled garden designed to keep shoppers within its ecosystem. Wingo points to the key elements of Amazon’s competitive retail moat, being the Prime membership program, Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA), its own payment processing, and countless other features specifically to ensure transactions flow through Amazon\\'s platform, generating fees and valuable data.\\nWhile \"Buy For Me\" keeps users firmly within the Amazon app interface throughout the entire process (as I explain with my own experience with the beta program below) it also abandons almost all of these sacred cows which are central to its core retail business.\\nThe question is: why would Amazon seemingly kill its golden goose?\\nFBI Warning—Stop These Calls On Your iPhone And Android Phone\\n‘NYT Mini’ Clues And Answers For Tuesday, April 8\\nWWE Raw Results, Winners And Grades On April 7, 2025\\nThe AI Shopping Race\\nThe answer likely lies in Amazon’s growing concern about AI shopping assistants potentially disrupting product discovery and purchase patterns – both of which are critical not only for its core business of selling physical products, but also for its ancillary but much more lucrative business of selling media space.\\nI recently wrote about in my Forbes article on Amazon’s patent for Alexa+, the company is racing to transform how consumers discover products through conversational AI, both within the web and app experience using its Rufus AI shopping assistant, and its nascent Alexa+ voice assistant.\\nAmazon says that Amazon Nova and Anthropic’s Claude models support the Amazon Shopping app’s agentic capabilities to complete the purchase from start to finish on a customer’s behalf.\\nIn my analysis of Amazon’s \\'Nova Act’, I highlighted how Amazon is battling with OpenAI and others to control the future of AI-driven shopping agents, like Operator. I argue that the company that owns the AI assistant consumers trust to handle their shopping will dominate retail\\'s future.\\n\"Buy For Me\" represents another strategic move in this battle. By allowing its AI to complete purchases across the web, Amazon positions itself as the front door for all shopping journeys – even those that end on other websites.\\nMy Experience With ‘Buy For Me’ As A Beta User\\nI was able to try the feature with footwear brand Rothy\\'s, which began selling on Amazon as a third-party seller just a year ago. After searching for \"Rothy\\'s,\" I found the Buy For Me widget a couple of lines down on the search results page.\\nWhat I discovered was particularly interesting: the variants in the Buy For Me widget appeared to be styles that aren\\'t sold on Amazon by the brand (The Casual Clog, Rothy\\'s Mens\\' Clog, The Loafer Mule). This suggests the feature helps brands show their full assortment to Amazon customers without making all variants available there.\\nScreenshot from Amazon app showing how eligible products display in the \"Buy For Me\" experience.\\nThe experience of using Buy For Me was seamless, if not a little cold and joyless – I selected my size, clicked the button to buy, and received an order confirmation, all within the Amazon app without being taken elsewhere. The prices matched those on Rothy’s website. Once I placed an order, it appeared in a separate section from my regular Amazon orders.\\nIn the workflow, Amazon also references a different feature that quietly appeared a few weeks ago: the ability to show customers products not available on Amazon.com when they search for a specific brand. Amazon said that the experience was designed to continue making shopping on Amazon convenient for customers.\\n“We’re testing bringing more selection and brands into our search results to help customers find even more of what they want and further improve our shopping experience for customers,” Rajiv Mehta, VP of Search and Conversational Shopping at Amazon said.\\nThese two initiatives, when placed side-by-side, demonstrate that Amazon is prepared to take a hit on its core retail business in order to continue being the primary destination for consumers in their shopping journey.\\nData Is The Real Prize With AI Shopping Agents\\nWhile Amazon seemingly sacrifices gross merchandise volume and merchant fees (at least while the program is in beta), the data collected through off-platform purchases provides the retail giant with increased visibility into consumer preferences. Every data point that Amazon collect on what a user’s interests, preferences, and behaviors are enables more sophisticated targeting options for advertisers and also informs Amazon’s own merchandising decisions.\\nSome industry experts commenting on LinkedIn believe this is primarily a data and advertising play. As Jason Goldberg, Chief Commerce Strategy Officer at Publicis noted, \"The bigger share of a customer wallet they see, the better they can target ads. They also squeeze out other digital wallets. Get early signals and new products sales velocity, etc.\"\\nThis theory makes sense given Amazon’s growing emphasis on its advertising business, which has consistently outpaced its retail sales growth. By capturing data about purchases made on other websites, Amazon expands its ability to provide targeted advertising – potentially charging brands to influence which products are suggested through the Buy For Me feature.\\nStrategic Implications\\nFor brands, Buy For Me creates an interesting opportunity. It potentially allows them to maintain direct customer relationships while leveraging Amazon’s massive traffic. Retailers using the feature can display their complete product assortment without providing their entire catalog on Amazon.\\nAmazon is clearly taking an \"innovator\\'s dilemma\" approach – focusing on aggregating shopper demand and delivering it, regardless of whether they own the inventory or collect the same merchant fees.\\nOne thing is certain: in the battle for AI shopping dominance, Amazon has just made a bold, unexpected move that signals how seriously they\\'re taking the threat – and opportunity – of agentic AI in retail. The company appears willing to sacrifice some of its most cherished principles to ensure it remains the starting point for consumer shopping journeys, no matter where those journeys end.'}, {'title':

Backtested performance is not an indicator of future actual results. The results reflect performance of a strategy not historically offered to investors and does not represent returns that any investor actually attained. Backtested results are calculated by the retroactive application of a model constructed on the basis of historical data and based on assumptions integral to the model which may or may not be testable and are subject to losses. General assumptions include: XYZ firm would have been able to purchase the securities recommended by the model and the markets were sufficiently liquid to permit all trading. Changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on the backtested returns presented. Certain assumptions have been made for modeling purposes and are unlikely to be realized. No representations and warranties are made as to the reasonableness of the assumptions. This information is provided for illustrative purposes only. Backtested performance is developed with the benefit of hindsight and has inherent limitations. Specifically, backtested results do not reflect actual trading or the effect of material economic and market factors on the decision-making process. Since trades have not actually been executed, results may have under- or over-compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity, and may not reflect the impact that certain economic or market factors may have had on the decision-making process. Further, backtesting allows the security selection methodology to be adjusted until past returns are maximized. Actual performance may differ significantly from backtested performance. Backtested results are adjusted to reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other income and, except where otherwise indicated, are presented gross-of fees and do not include the effect of backtested transaction costs, management fees, performance fees or expenses, if applicable. Please note all regulatory considerations regarding the presentation of fees must be taken into account. No cash balance or cash flow is included in the calculation.\\n✕\\nDo not sell or share my personal information.\\nYou have chosen to opt-out of the sale or sharing of your information from this site and any of its affiliates.

The United States has imposed a 20% tariff on China, accusing it of being a source of synthetic drugs, and from April 9th, a reciprocal tariff of 34% will be added, bringing the total tariff to 54%.\\nAccording to news sites Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, people worried that iPhone prices might go up are flocking to Apple Stores. @schmuck, who recently visited an Apple Store in Chicago, said in a photo that the store doesn't look 'crowded,' but some stores are reporting that sales in the past week have exceeded those of the previous year.\\nWhile Apple did not comment on the matter, it has announced plans to increase supplies from India, where reciprocal tariffs are lower than China's at 26%, as a short-term stopgap measure.\\nNews site Bloomberg pointed out that since Apple is selling inventory, this could have a positive impact on its third-quarter results (April-June 2025), and that the negative impact of the tariffs would not become apparent until the quarter after July.\\nRelated Posts:\\nPresident Trump's announcement of mutual tariffs hits the tech industry hard, causing stock prices of Apple, Amazon, Meta, NVIDIA, Alphabet and Microsoft to plummet\\nApple stops selling products in Turkey following the collapse of the Turkish lira\\nDoes the 60 GB model that cheaper prices come to Xbox 360\\nDo you want to lose if you do not buy now?
